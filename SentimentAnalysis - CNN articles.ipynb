       "'US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy visited Paul Whelan on Thursday— her first visit to the detained American since taking up the post in Moscow earlier this year.  \"His release remains an absolute priority,\" the US Embassy in Moscow said on Twitter.\\xa0 Whelan is serving out his prison sentence at a prison camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow. Background on Whelan\\'s case: The American citizen, who also holds Irish, British and Canadian citizenship, was detained in Russia in December 2018 and later sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge, which he strongly denies.\\xa0 In an interview with CNN in December, Whelan described the prison camp\\xa0as \"better than most in Russia because it\\'s mostly foreigners held here, but the conditions are extremely bad.\" Although Thursday was Tracy\\'s first in-person visit, she has spoken by phone with Whelan in the past. The US government was unable to secure Whelan\\'s release last year when they brought home two other wrongfully detained Americans: Trevor Reed in April and Brittney Griner in December. Other detained Americans: Whelan is one of two Americans still in Russia who has been designated as wrongfully detained. The other, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, was imprisoned more than a month ago. Read more here.  The United States still does not have information needed to provide an assessment on this week\\'s alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, according to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. “You\\'ve seen the Ukrainian government deny their having engaged in this. And, at this stage we don\\'t have information that would allow us to provide an independent assessment on this,” Haines said. In an exchange with Sen. Tom Cotton at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Haines confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not “spend the night at the Kremlin all that much” and that Ukraine denied the attack, whereas in past attacks against Russia, Ukraine has been “ambiguous or silent about responsibility for the attacks.” “Perhaps some grounds to think that maybe these claims are exaggerated,” Cotton said. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier said Russia’s claim that Ukraine tried to assassinate Putin with American assistance was likely “misinformation.” Some background: CNN analysis of videos showing the incident support the Kremlin’s claim that two drones were flown above the government compound early Wednesday, but did not show evidence it was a Ukrainian attack. Ukraine has flatly denied any involvement, saying it only strikes within its own territory and is not launching attacks in Russia. The White House has called the Kremlin\\'s accusation that it was involved in an attempt on Putin\\'s life \"ridiculous.\" ##Kremlin Incident## Russia will likely not be able to mount a “significant offensive operation this year” due to munitions and manpower shortages — whether or not the Ukrainian counteroffensive is successful, according to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. “In fact, if Russia does not initiate a mandatory mobilization and secure substantial third-party ammunition supplies beyond existing deliveries from Iran and others, it will be increasingly challenging for them to sustain even modest offensive operations,” Haines testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Putin “probably” has scaled back his near-term ambitions in Ukraine to consider a victory “to consolidate control of the occupied territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, and ensuring that Ukraine will never become a NATO ally,” Haines added. Despite this assessment, Haines said it wasn\\'t very likely that Russia negotiates a pause this year unless political factors \"alter his thinking.\" Haines also noted that Russian forces are preparing “new defensive positions” for the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and have “gained less territory in April than during any of the three previous months.” Here\\'s where the state of Russian control in Ukrainian territory stands: There is a “persistent and significant risk” that Russia could target critical allied infrastructure, including undersea internet cables, as part of its war on\\xa0Ukraine, David Cattler, NATO’s assistant secretary general for intelligence and security, said. “There are heightened concerns that Russia may target undersea cables and other critical infrastructure in an effort to disrupt Western life and gain leverage against those nations that are providing support to\\xa0Ukraine,” Cattler told reporters on Wednesday.\\xa0 According to Cattler, more than 95% of international internet traffic is transmitted through roughly 400 undersea cables. These cables “carry an estimated 10 trillion US dollars worth of financial transactions every day,” he said, adding that they are an “economic linchpin.” While Russia is “actively mapping” this infrastructure, Cattler said, “China is another significant actor on the seabed.” Beijing, Cattler added, is working towards developing its own undersea infrastructure rather than “extensively testing the vulnerabilities of other nations’.” NATO allies are monitoring the situation closely, Cattler stated. “This is really a holistic, multi-spectrum, multi-domain threat set when it comes to critical infrastructure. Cooperation between the private sector and NATO and allied governance is really crucial in order to have a clear threat picture,\" he said.  A Pentagon spokesperson denied US involvement in the purported drone attack on the Kremlin and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson of lying.\\xa0 \"I would just tell you Mr. (Dmitry) Peskov\\'s lying. I mean, it\\'s obviously a ludicrous claim. The United States had nothing to do with this. We don\\'t even know what happened here,\" said John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications.\\xa0\"But I can assure you the United States had no role in it whatsoever.\" The White House still has no indication who was behind the drone attack and said the White House does not \"endorse, we do not encourage, we do not support attacks on individual leaders,\" Kirby added.\\xa0 Russia has accused Washington of being behind what it says was a drone attack on the Kremlin and an assassination attempt against Putin, the latest in a series of\\xa0extraordinary allegations\\xa0over Wednesday\\'s incident. “We are well aware that decisions on such actions and such terrorist attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington. And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, without providing any evidence. Belgium is preparing a new package of military aid for Ukraine as Russia\\'s war continues,\\xa0Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Thursday. “As we know, in these military aid packages, there are often practical obstacles. But I can tell you that there is not a single doubt in any of the Belgian hearts and minds that we need to continue to support Ukraine,” De Croo told a news conference in The Hague alongside Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\\xa0 De Croo also said Belgium was examining how seized Russian assets could be “fully” used to support Ukraine’s war effort, as well as to aid the reconstruction of the war-torn country.\\xa0 Meanwhile, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday that while there were “no taboos” when it came to military support for Ukraine, the question of whether NATO would supply Kyiv with F-16 fighter jets remained unresolved. “We are not there yet,” he added.\\xa0 Remember: Ukraine has been lobbying for US-made fighter jets for several months, with officials arguing they are needed to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks.\\xa0 Ukraine\\'s message is that it will be a NATO member after the war has ended, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday. \"We are realistic and know that we will not be in NATO during the war. But during the war we want to get a very clear message that we will be in NATO after the war,\" Zelensky said in a joint news conference in the Netherlands with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. Zelensky said that while Ukraine has received \"some positive messages\" from countries who support it, \"we need something more.\" \"I think that our friends will support us and see us in NATO,\"\\xa0the Ukrainian president added. Remember: Part of Russia’s premise for its invasion of Ukraine was to fend off NATO from expanding close to its borders. NATO Secretary General\\xa0Jens Stoltenberg\\xa0has said, “Ukraine’s future is in NATO.” Even though Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, and NATO has insisted that it is not a party to the conflict, the bloc has\\xa0played a critical role\\xa0in supporting Kyiv, donating billions in military aid and other support.  At the news conference, Zelensky also appealed for its allies to deliver their promised weapons to Kyiv as quickly as possible. \"The most important thing now is to deliver what was promised to our soldiers as quickly as possible.\" The US and Ukraine have vehemently denied Moscow\\'s unsubstantiated claims that both parties led an alleged drone strike targeting the Kremlin and assassination attempt on President Vladimir Putin, the latest in a series of heated exchanges between Ukraine and its Western allies and Russia over the incident on Wednesday.  Here are the latest developments: Diplomatic fallout: White House official John Kirby called accusations from Russia that the US directed Ukraine to carry out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin and assassination attempt on President Vladimir Putin \"ridiculous.\"\\nEU urges calm: The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Russia not to intensify attacks on Ukraine, saying: \"We call Russia not to use this alleged attack as an excuse to continue the escalation of the war.\"\\nKyiv withstands Russian strikes: Ukrainian air defenses repelled Russia\\'s most intense wave of air attacks on Kyiv since the start of the year overnight into Thursday, the capital region\\'s military chief said, adding there were no civilian casualties or damage to residential buildings and infrastructure.\\nZelensky calls for Putin trial: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin “deserves to be sentenced” for Moscow\\'s invasion, during a speech at the International Criminal Court (ICC) headquarters in the Netherlands. \\nOil fires in Russia: Russia\\'s federal investigative authority is launching a probe into fires at oil facilities in the southwestern Rostov region, after Moscow accused Ukraine of hitting the depots in a series of targeted attacks. Kyiv has not commented on the blazes. ##Catch Up## Ukrainian air defenses withstood Russia\\'s most intense wave of air attacks on Kyiv since the start of the year overnight into Thursday, the capital region\\'s military chief said. \"Our city has not experienced such a heavy intensity of attacks since the beginning of this year! Last night, the aggressor launched another large-scale air strike on the capital,\" Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, wrote on Telegram. All Russian missiles and drones \"were destroyed in Kyiv airspace by our air defense forces,\" Popko said after Moscow\\'s forces attacked the city with \"Shahed-type barrage munitions and missiles, presumably ballistic.\"  There were no civilian casualties or damage to residential buildings and infrastructure, he added. Blasts heard: Explosions were heard in Kyiv and Odesa early Thursday morning, according to Ukrainian parliament member Oleksii Honcharenko. Kyiv’s regional military administration said air defenses were activated in Kyiv, and a map by Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation showed air alerts were sounded in most of the eastern half of the country. ##Russian Strikes## John Kirby, the National Security Council’s Coordinator for Strategic Communications,\\xa0called accusations from Russia that the US directed Ukraine to carry out an alleged Kremlin drone attack and assassination attempt on President Vladimir Putin \"ridiculous.\" His remarks came after Moscow spokesperson Dmitry Peskov alleged without any evidence that the US was behind the purported drone attack, and suggested the Ukrainian government was implementing decisions made in Washington. “We are well aware that decisions on such actions and such terrorist attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington. And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do,” Peskov\\xa0said on Thursday. “Such attempts to disown this both in Kyiv and in Washington are, of course, absolutely ridiculous.” Ukraine vehemently denied responsibility for the alleged incident on Wednesday, as a series of extraordinary allegations from Moscow inflamed tensions between the two sides even further.  ##Kremlin Incident## The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Russia not to intensify attacks on Ukraine, after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting the Kremlin in an alleged drone strike and assassination attempt on President Vladimir Putin. “We call Russia not to use this alleged attack as an excuse to continue the escalation of the war. This is what worries us,” Borrell told reporters in Brussels.\\xa0 “What worries us is this can be used in order to justify more conscription of people, soldiers, more attacks on Ukraine.\" Borrell added that the \"only solution for the war\" is to support Ukraine “militarily, politically and economically.” “The best solution for the war, the only solution for the war, is Russia stopping the attack and withdrawing their troops from Ukraine.\" His remarks came as the Kremlin accused Ukraine of following orders by the US to carry out the alleged attack. Ukraine on Wednesday denied any involvement in the strike. US officials said earlier this week they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible. ##Kremlin Incident## Russia has accused Washington of being behind what it says was a drone attack on the Kremlin and an assassination attempt against President Vladimir Putin, the latest in a series of extraordinary allegations over the incident on Wednesday. When asked by CNN if the Kremlin believed the US was behind the attack, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “Undoubtedly, Such decisions, the definition of goals, the definition of means -- all this is dictated to Kyiv from Washington.”\\xa0 “We are well aware of this,” he added. “We are well aware that decisions on such actions and such terrorist attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington. And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do,\" Peskov said.\\xa0\\n“Such attempts to disown this both in Kyiv and in Washington are, of course, absolutely ridiculous.” The Kremlin spokesperson doubled down on the accusations, without providing any evidence, expanding on Russia’s view of how these decisions are made. “We know that it is often not even Kyiv who determines the goals themselves, they are determined in Washington, and then these goals are brought to Kyiv so that Kyiv fulfils [those tasks],” Peskov said. “Not every time Kyiv is given the right to choose the means, this is also often ordered from across the ocean.” “Washington must clearly understand that we know this,” he added. Peskov did not provide any evidence to his claims, nor additional details regarding the alleged attack, saying that information would be released later. He also told journalists Putin is \"calm,\" despite the alleged attack and assassination attempt. “You know that in such difficult, extreme situations, the president always remains calm, collected, clear in his assessments, in the commands he gives out,\" he added. \"Therefore, nothing changed in this regard.” He told CNN during the call with reporters that the alleged strike damaged two of the Senate Palace’s copper sheets, which will be repaired.  Some background: Earlier this week, Russia claimed Ukraine launched a drone strike targeting the Kremlin in an attempt to kill Putin, the official residence of the Russian president and the most potent symbol of power in Moscow. Ukraine has strongly denied involvement in the alleged strike.  US officials said earlier that they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible.

And these are ordinary innocent people who have done nothing to deserve this terrible fate,” Hoekstra said in an introductory speech. “And we can never accept this. And we will do everything in our power to ensure that Russia is being held to account,\" Hoekstra added. “Together with all those who want peace and believe in justice.” Hoekstra\\'s remarks preceded Zelensky\\'s comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin “deserves to be sentenced” for Moscow\\'s invasion. \"Of course we want to see Vladimir here in the Hague,” Zelensky said while speaking at the World Forum. “The one who deserves to be sentenced for these criminal actions right here in the capital of the international law.\" Remember: The ICC has launched several war crimes investigations over alleged atrocities committed by Moscow, issuing arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, a member of Putin\\'s government. ##Kremlin Incident## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin “deserves to be sentenced” for Moscow\\'s invasion, during a speech at the International Criminal Court (ICC) headquarters in the Netherlands where the ongoing conflict was likely at the top of his agenda.  \"Of course we want to see Vladimir here in the Hague,” Zelensky said while speaking at the World Forum. “The one who deserves to be sentenced for these criminal actions right here in the capital of the international law.\" “I\\'m sure we will see that happen when we win and we will win and when we win not just on the battlefield, not just against this aggression. Look at how countries around the world are coming together to help Ukrainians defend themselves, whatever their heart have this desire to help the feeling that more than the fate of one country is at stake,\" he said.  Some background: The ICC has launched several war crimes investigations linked to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, where Kyiv, allied officials and the media have reported alleged atrocities committed by Moscow\\'s troops.  In March, the court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, a member of Putin\\'s government, for an alleged scheme to forcibly deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.  At the same time, the ICC\\'s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN he believes\\xa0Russian President Vladimir Putin\\xa0could stand trial for alleged crimes committed during the conflict, despite Moscow’s arguments that it is not subject to the court’s decisions. CNN\\'s Rob Picheta, Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Caitlin Hu contributed reporting. Russia\\'s federal investigative authority is launching a probe into fires at oil facilities in the southwestern Rostov region, after Moscow accused Ukraine of hitting the depots in a series of targeted attacks. According to a statement published by the Russian Investigative Committee on Telegram, the investigation will focus on the fires at the Novoshakhtinsk oil products plant in Rostov among other “criminal actions by the Armed formations of Ukraine.” Kyiv has not commented on the fires.  The Russian Investigative Committee said an unmanned aerial vehicle “crashed into the structures of the plant\\'s inter-workshop flyover under construction,\"  on Wednesday night. “The fire that resulted from the explosion was immediately extinguished. There were no casualties or injuries, and minor damage was caused to structures,” the statement commented. The committee said it will also be investigating an unmanned aerial vehicle attack on a water tower in the Belgorod Region, as well as a fire that broke out at an oil refinery in the village of Ilsky in the Krasnodar region. It said it believed the blaze was caused by an attack of an “unknown unmanned aerial vehicle.” Some context: Border attacks between Moscow and Kyiv have been ramping up in recent weeks. They included civilian and infrastructure targets and suggest an attempt to exhaust each other ahead of an anticipated Ukrainian spring offensive.  Russia launched its most forceful air bombardment on Kyiv since the start of the year, the Kyiv\\xa0City Military Administration said, adding that Ukrainian air defenses destroyed all of the missiles aiming at the capital.  The barrage of attacks followed Moscow\\'s allegations that Ukraine\\xa0attempted to assassinate\\xa0Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone strike at the Kremlin overnight on Wednesday, accusations Kyiv has vehemently denied. Here are the latest developments: Kyiv resists Russian strikes: All Russian missiles and drones \"were destroyed in Kyiv airspace\" by Ukrainian air defense forces on Thursday, avoiding civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, the capital\\'s military chief said.\\nMoscow batters Kherson: The death toll from Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian city and its surrounding villages has risen to at least 23 people. Moscow struck Kherson at least 16 times, firing over 80 shells at Pryvokzalna Square, a railway station and crossing, a gas station, two stores, a factory and a car repair shop, the regional military administration said.\\nRussian oil plant fire: A blaze broke out at a petroleum plant in southwestern Russia on Wednesday night after a drone attack, according to the regional governor. It was the third apparent Ukrainian strike on a Russian fuel depot in two days. Ukraine has not commented on the incident.\\nZelensky arrives in the Netherlands: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in the Netherlands to deliver a speech at The Hague on Thursday. He will be\\xa0visiting the International Criminal Court, where war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine are being investigated. \\n\"For the Kremlin\": Messages written on Russian drones launched at Odesa in southern Ukraine overnight read “for Moscow” and “for the Kremlin,” according to the Ukrainian military, an apparent reference to an alleged assassination attempt against Russian President Vladimir Putin -- for which Ukraine has vehemently denied any responsibility.  ##Catch Up## The death toll has risen to 23 following Russian shelling of the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine and its surrounding villages on Wednesday, the regional military chief said Thursday. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration said on Telegram that another 46 people were injured, including two children. Russian forces shelled Kherson 16 times, including its residential area, he said. More than 80 shells hit Pryvokzalna Square, a railway station and crossing, a gas station, two stores, a factory and a car repair shop, he added. The regional military administration has declared Thursday through Saturday as days of mourning, he added. Following the shelling Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “The world needs to see and know this.”  “A railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket, a gas station — do you know what unites these places? The bloody trail that Russia leaves with its shells, killing civilians in Kherson and Kherson region.” ##Russian Strikes## Messages written on Russian drones launched at Odesa overnight read “for Moscow” and “for the Kremlin,” according to the Ukrainian military, an apparent reference to an alleged  assassination attempt against Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Photos released by Ukraine’s Southern Command show the messages written on two tails of the drones, which the command said showed the apparent “reason for the attack.” According to the Southern Command, 15 Shahed-131/136 drones were fired at Odesa, of which 12 were destroyed by air defense forces and mobile fire groups. The other three struck dormitories of an educational institution.  Kremlin incident: Ukraine has denied any involvement in what Russia says was a drone attack on the Kremlin and an assassination attempt against Putin early Wednesday morning. Video on social media shows a bright flash and a puff of smoke over a part of the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president and the most potent symbol of power in Moscow. Putin was not in the building at the time, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the accusations, saying during a news conference: \"We don\\'t attack Putin or Moscow.\"  US officials said they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible.  Meanwhile, A former Russian lawmaker linked with militant groups in the country told CNN the alleged\\xa0attack was the work of Russian partisans, not the Ukrainian military.\\xa0 ##Kremlin Incident## ##Russian Strikes## Fire broke out a petroleum plant in southwestern Russia on Wednesday night after a drone attack, according to a regional governor — the third apparent Ukrainian strike on a Russian fuel depot in two days. The drone crashed into the construction site of an overpass at the Novoshakhtinsk plant near the village of Kiselevka, Rostov Gov. Vasily Golubev said on Telegram on Thursday. Staff at the plant immediately extinguished the fire, he added.  No casualties or injuries were reported and the strike caused little damage to the facilities, Golubev said.\\xa0 It is unclear who is responsible for the alleged attack.\\xa0 Oil targeted: According to Russian state media and officials, the alleged attack is the third such strike launched by Ukraine against fuel depots inside Russian territory in the past two days. A fire broke out at the Ilsky oil refinery in the southwestern Krasnodar region, caused by \"an attack by an unknown drone,\" state-run news agency Tass reported earlier Thursday. There were no casualties, according to Krasnodar Gov. Veniamin Kondratiev. And on Wednesday, Russian state media reported a\\xa0drone strike ignited a fire\\xa0that engulfed an oil storage facility in the port of Volna, also in Krasnodar. That facility is close to the\\xa0Kerch bridge\\xa0that was set ablaze by Ukrainian forces in October 2022. It is unclear how the fuel storage tank caught fire. Ukraine has not commented on the incidents. Some context: CNN\\'s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh writes that Ukraine is apparently striking at fuel depots in Russian-occupied areas and inside Russia itself — seemingly precise attacks but ones to which Kyiv is making no overt claim. Increased cross-border attacks from both Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks appear to be an attempt to weaken each other ahead of a long anticipated spring offensive. Ukraine’s Air Force destroyed 18 of 24 drones fired by Russia on Wednesday night, it said in a statement released early Thursday. “On (Wednesday night), the enemy again attacked with Shaheds from the north (Bryansk region) and from the south - the eastern coast of the Azov Sea,\" the statement said. \"This time, the Air Force, in cooperation with the air defense of other components of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, destroyed 18 attack UAVs.” Intense attacks: Explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv and Odesa early Thursday morning, with air defenses activated and people told to stay in safe places until air alerts stopped ringing, according to Ukrainian officials. The capital region\\'s military chief said Ukrainian air defenses withstood Russia\\'s most intense air attack on Kyiv since the start of the year overnight and into Thursday morning, and destroyed all Russian missiles and drones.  There were no civilian casualties or damage to residential buildings and infrastructure, he added. ##Russian Strikes## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the Netherlands on Wednesday to deliver a speech at The Hague on Thursday, according to Dutch public broadcaster NOS.\\xa0 Zelensky\\'s speech is titled “No Peace Without Justice.\"  Later Thursday, he will visit the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine are being investigated, NOS reported. Zelensky traveled to the Netherlands from Finland, where he met with his Finnish and other Nordic counterparts on Wednesday.  In a statement ahead of that meeting, the Finnish president said the prime ministers of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland planned to discuss the war in Ukraine and Kyiv\\'s \"initiative for a just peace.\" Ukraine\\xa0has vehemently denied Russia\\'s allegation that it attempted to assassinate Russian President\\xa0Vladimir Putin in a drone strike at the Kremlin overnight on Wednesday, Moscow said Putin was not in the building at the time of the attack. Meanwhile, a former Russian lawmaker linked with militant groups in the country told CNN the attack was the work of what he calls Russian partisans, not the Ukrainian military.\\xa0 Here are the latest developments:  Explosions and air alerts: Blasts were heard in Kyiv and Odesa early Thursday morning, with air defenses activated in Kyiv, according to a Ukrainian official and the regional military administration. Air alerts rang out in most of the eastern half of Ukraine, and civilians were warned to \"stay in safe places\" until the alert is over.\\nOil refinery fire: An alleged drone attack caused a fire at an oil refinery in southwestern Russia on Thursday — the second apparent cross-border strike on a Russian fuel depot in two days, according to Russian state media.\\nKherson attacks: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lashed out against Russia after at least 21 people were killed by shelling in the southern Kherson region Wednesday.\\n\"Heightened threat\": The US embassy in Ukraine warned Wednesday there was a \"heightened threat of missile attacks,” including in Kyiv. It pointed to an uptick in strikes across Ukraine, and \"inflammatory rhetoric from Moscow.\"\\nMore US assistance:  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $300 million security assistance package for Ukraine Wednesday. It is the 37th drawdown of US arms and equipment for Ukraine, he said. ##Catch Up##  Explosions were heard in Kyiv and Odesa early Thursday morning, said Oleksii Honcharenko, a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), on Telegram. Air defenses have been activated in Kyiv, the city\\'s regional military administration said. Air alerts have been activated in most of the eastern half of the country, according to a map posted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation. Yuri Malashko, head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, called for people to “stay in safe places” until the air alert is over. ##Russian Strikes## A fire broke out in the reservoir of Russia’s Ilsky oil refinery in the southwestern Krasnodar region, state-run news agency Tass reported early Thursday. Citing emergency services, Tass said the fire was caused by a drone strike. “Due to an attack by an unknown drone, a fuel tank at the Ilsky Oil Refinery in the urban-type settlement of Ilsky in the Seversky district caught fire,\" Tass quoted emergency services, adding that firefighters have been dispatched to the site. There were no casualties, according to Krasnodar Gov. Veniamin Kondratiev, who said in a Telegram post that residents are no longer in danger. “It\\'s been a second turbulent night in a row for our emergency services. A tank of petroleum products at the Ilsky Oil Refinery in the Seversky District has now been confirmed to be on fire. Fire brigades and MES staff of 48 people and 16 vehicles are already at work,” he said. Fuel to the fire: It comes after Russian state media on Wednesday said a\\xa0drone strike ignited a fire\\xa0that engulfed an oil storage facility in the port of Volna in Krasnodar. Videos published on social media and geolocated by CNN show the oil storage tanks burning. That facility is close to the\\xa0Kerch bridge\\xa0that was set ablaze by Ukrainian forces in October 2022. It is unclear how the fuel storage tank caught fire and Ukraine has not commented on the incident. A former Russian lawmaker linked with militant groups in Russia claims an alleged\\xa0drone attack on the Kremlin\\xa0on Wednesday was the work of what he calls Russian partisans, not the Ukrainian military.\\xa0 In an exclusive interview, Ilya Ponomarev told CNN’s Matthew Chance that \"it\\'s one of Russian partisan groups,\" adding that \"I cannot say more, as they have not yet publicly claimed responsibility.\" Ponomarev, who lives in exile in Ukraine and Poland, was the only Russian MP to vote against the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and has since been included on a list of terrorist suspects, according to the Russian authorities.\\xa0 On Wednesday, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of being responsible for two drone attacks on the Kremlin.\\xa0 In a statement, the Kremlin said, “We view these actions as a planned terrorist attack and an assassination attempt,” adding that “Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures wherever and whenever it deems appropriate.\" Ukraine has denied\\xa0any involvement in the alleged drone strike. More on partisans: According to Ponomarev, members of partisans group inside Russia are usually \"youngsters, students, residents of large cities. I am aware of the partisan activity in approximately 40 cities across Russia,\" he told CNN.\\xa0 \"All partisan groups have their own focus, their speciality, their core knowledge. Some of them are focused on railroad sabotages, some of them are doing arson of military recruitment posts. Some of them are doing attacks on pro-war activists, some of them are doing hacking attacks,\" he said.\\xa0 According to Ponomarev, the alleged drone attacks inside Russia are a \"new line of operation\" for the groups, which he says pose a “real threat.\" \"What Putin is selling to the nation and especially to the elites is the feeling of invulnerability and security. And partisans are ruining both. They are actually saying the war is here and you guys, you personally, are not safe,\" Ponomarev said. ##Kremlin Incident## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lashed out at Russia after he said at least 21 people were\\xa0killed by shelling\\xa0in the southern Kherson region.\\xa0 “The world needs to see and know this,” Zelensky wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. “A railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket, a gas station — do you know what unites these places? The bloody trail that Russia leaves with its shells, killing civilians in Kherson and Kherson region.” Zelensky added that at least 48 people were also wounded and sent his condolences to the families and friends of those affected.\\xa0 “We will never forgive the culprits,” he vowed. “We will defeat evil state and hold all the perpetrators to account.\" ##Russian Strikes## For days now, the blasts have echoed the condition each\\xa0country’s military\\xa0is in. Ukraine is apparently striking at fuel depots in Russian-occupied areas and inside Russia itself — seemingly precise attacks but ones to which Kyiv is making no overt claim. Russia has been lashing out at what often seem to be civilian targets in Ukraine, either in rage or through ineptitude. In\\xa0Uman, more than 20 people died; in\\xa0Pavlohrad, there were two dead and many injured. In Kherson on Wednesday, three were killed when a crowded hypermarket was hit at 11 in the morning. And in Zaporizhzhia, two rockets slammed into a quiet residential garden that same overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, leaving a crater in a genteel, freshly sculpted lawn. Nobody died in this last strike, but perhaps only because the first missile sent two families rushing for cover before the second struck. During the night, the city of Zaporizhzhia was blasted with repeated air raid sirens — a familiar noise in the past months, but this time accompanied by explosions, suggesting Moscow’s escalation, as Russian forces apparently send S300 missiles into cities, according to local officials and accounts. We don’t often know when Russia hits a military target in Ukraine, but the number of strikes on civilian targets suggests either extreme negligence and inaccuracy, or a tactic of intentionally terrifying ordinary people. A pattern is forming, outside of Moscow’s repeated disregard for human life. Night by night, each side appears to be trying to weaken the other. The Ukrainian strikes have hit obvious infrastructure targets — railroad tracks, huge fuel depots — which suggest both how researched their coming campaign is, and how poorly prepared Russia is. It is still, for the most part, doing things in the same old, obvious way. The signals ahead of Ukraine’s long-heralded counteroffensive are getting louder. For two weeks, a slight uptick in clashes has been reported by pro-Russian officials along the Zaporizhzhia front lines, through which Kyiv’s forces will likely have to push if they are to separate the occupied peninsula of Crimea from the rest of occupied Ukraine — a key strategic goal. It is unclear if this uptick is Ukraine probing, or business as usual — and that is entirely the point. Read the full analysis here. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $300 million security assistance package for Ukraine Wednesday. “This latest package will help Ukraine continue to bravely defend itself in the face of Russia’s brutal, unprovoked, and unjustified war. Russia could end its war today. Until Russia does, the United States and our allies and partners will stand united with Ukraine, for as long as it takes,” Blinken said. The top US diplomat said it is the 37th drawdown of US arms and equipment for Ukraine. Here\\'s what\\'s in the package: Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)\\n155mm Howitzers\\n155mm artillery rounds\\n120mm, 81mm, and 60mm mortar rounds\\nTube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles\\nAT-4 and Carl Gustaf anti-armor weapon systems\\nHydra-70 aircraft rockets\\nSmall arms and small arms ammunition\\nDemolition munitions for obstacle clearing\\nTrucks and trailers to transport heavy equipment\\nTesting and diagnostic equipment to support vehicle maintenance and repair\\nSpare parts and other field equipment Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the package comes after \"extensive work by the US government over the past few months to fulfill Ukraine\\'s requests ahead of its planned counteroffensive and ensure they have the weapons and equipment they need.\" The White House said it will continue to work with allies to support Ukraine. Previewing this aid package earlier this week, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby suggested the new package would be \"very much focused on ammunition and clearing capabilities\" to give Ukraine \"what they need to break through Russian defenses.\" \"They will be ready,\" Kirby said. Russia claimed Ukraine launched an attempt to kill Russian\\xa0President Vladimir Putin\\xa0with a drone strike on the Kremlin overnight on Wednesday, an extraordinary allegation that was met with forceful denials in Kyiv. The Kremlin said the attack was foiled and the alleged drones destroyed. Video that appeared on social media shows a bright flash and a puff of smoke over a part of the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president and the most potent symbol of power in Moscow. In a statement, the Kremlin said it regarded the alleged attack as terrorism and a deliberate attempt on Putin’s life. “Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit,” it added. Ukraine\\xa0denied involvement in the alleged strike. “As President Zelensky has stated numerous times before, Ukraine uses all means at its disposal to free its own territory, not to attack others,” the Ukrainian presidential spokesman, Sergiy Nykyforov, told CNN on Wednesday. US officials said they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible. Whatever the truth, any admission of a security breach at the heart of the Kremlin is remarkable. Moscow said the alleged attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday. The Russian president was not in the building at the time, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. CNN analysis of video showing the incident support the Kremlin’s claim that two drones were flown above the Kremlin early Wednesday, but did not show evidence of Ukrainian involvement: Read more here. ##Kremlin Incident##'"
