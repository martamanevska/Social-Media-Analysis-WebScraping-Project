0,"In Russia’s war in Ukraine, both sides have attacked water supplies",,21/03/22,"Shortly after Vladimir Putin began his bloody invasion of Ukraine, Russian soldiers destroyed a dam in the Kherson oblast that had blocked water from flowing into Crimea. The move was symbolic as well as utilitarian. Ukraine built the dam in 2014 after Russia annexed the peninsula, cutting off more than 80% of Crimea’s water supply and crippling harvests. This is not the first time water has played a role in Ukraine’s relationship with its neighbour. For years before the invasion, fighting in separatist areas of eastern Ukraine frequently damaged water infrastructure. When shrapnel hit a pipeline in 2019 more than 3m people were left without water. Clashes involving water are becoming more common around the world. A new update to the Water Conflict Chronology, a database maintained by the Pacific Institute, a think-tank in Oakland, California, chronicles 1,300 water conflicts over the past 4,500 years. But their frequency has recently sped up. There were 127 of them in 2021, up from only 22 in 2000 (see chart). Peter Gleick, who created the chronology in the 1980s, sorts water conflicts into three buckets: water as a trigger of conflict; water as a weapon of war; and water systems as a casualty of violence.As is true of many conflicts in the database, water was not the cause of the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to water systems and water scarcity are often symptoms of broader disputes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most water conflicts in the past two decades have occurred in thirsty regions of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. But no region is completely spared. Disputes over water also break out in rich, Western countries. Last year right-wing extremists in America threatened to take control of water facilities in the Klamath river basin, a drought-stricken area near the border between Oregon and California. Such conflicts are not just about drinking water and agriculture; sanitation and public health are also at risk. If a hospital does not have clean, running water, for example, treating sick people becomes much harder. “We see these conflicts most often in places where basic human services are not available to everyone,” says Mr Gleick. Perhaps for that reason, dignitaries at the World Water Forum in Dakar, Senegal, this week will focus heavily on sanitation in poor countries. These conflicts will probably continue to proliferate as climate change intensifies droughts and extreme-weather events. Fights over water are more common in parched countries where climate change is diminishing water supplies, such as Syria and the Gulf states. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that drought can inflame tensions, particularly in places dependent on agriculture for local food supply. Not all struggles over supply lead to conflict. In some instances, the IPCC says, changes in water supply can force countries that share aquifers and rivers to collaborate. But downstream states will always watch their upstream neighbours with unease. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

1,Does a protracted conflict favour Russia or Ukraine?,,30/06/22,"The typical war is short. Since 1815, the median duration of wars between states has been just over three months, calculates Paul Poast of the University of Chicago. In 2003 America toppled the government of Iraq in just 20 days. The conflict that Armenia and Azerbaijan fought over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 was over in 44. Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has entered its fifth month, and shows no sign of drawing to a close. “I am afraid that we need to steel ourselves for a long war,” wrote Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, in mid-June. Jens Stoltenberg, nato’s secretary-general, echoed his warning: “We must prepare for the fact that it could take years.”Your browser does not support the <audio> element.In the early days of the invasion the West worried that Ukrainian forces would be swiftly overwhelmed by Russia’s superior firepower and resistance would collapse. Now the fears are different: that Ukraine has not adjusted its strategy enough to fight a sustained war of attrition; that it will run out of soldiers and munitions; that months of pummelling will cause its economy to collapse; that the will to fight may ebb as the going gets even tougher. Russia, too, is subject to many of the same pressures, with the conflict chewing up its young men, sapping its economy and accelerating its descent into dictatorship. A protracted conflict will also test the resolve of Ukraine’s Western allies, as the price of food and energy soars, inflation riles voters and Ukraine’s requests for weapons and cash escalate. A long war, in short, will test both sides in new ways. Whether it favours Russia or Ukraine depends in large part on how the West responds.Start on the battlefield. Russia’s army is making headway, albeit slowly. Ukrainian forces have been ordered to withdraw from the town of Severodonetsk, putting Russia within spitting distance of controlling all of Luhansk province, one of two that together form the Donbas region. Slovyansk, in the north-east of Donetsk, the other province in Donbas, is also under attack (see map).Ukraine’s forces, outgunned and until recently largely outranged in artillery, have been mauled. The government says they are suffering as many as 200 casualties a day. On June 15th a Ukrainian general said that the army had lost 1,300 armoured vehicles, 400 tanks and 700 artillery systems, far more than previously thought. Many of Ukraine’s most experienced and best-trained units have been destroyed, leaving greener reservists to take their place. On June 19th British defence intelligence said there had been desertions among Ukrainian troops.Yet this does not mean Russia will sweep through Donbas. Its advance has been slow, grinding and costly, enabled only by massive, indiscriminate bombardments. New recruits are getting just a few days of training before being thrown into battle, according to the bbc’s Russian service. Morale is low: British intelligence points to “armed stand-offs between officers and their troops”. It has taken more than two months to capture Severodonetsk, and Slovyansk and next-door Kramatorsk are better fortified. Russia still has plenty of munitions and equipment, says Richard Connolly, an expert on the country’s economy and defence industry. Russian arms factories are said to be working double or triple shifts, he notes. Russia also has large stockpiles of old tanks to draw on. Over time, shortages will bite, but they are more likely to lead to the deployment of outmoded or poorly maintained weapons than to a total drought, Mr Connolly believes. Manpower is a bigger problem. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has refused to call up conscripts and reservists en masse. Instead of a general mobilisation, says Michael Kofman of cna, a think-tank, his army is creating new reserve battalions by signing up new recruits. But finding enough of them is difficult: the government has had to offer lavish pay, of almost three times the median wage. The injured and bereaved have been promised generous settlements, too. The Duma, Russia’s parliament, recently lifted the maximum age to join the army from 40 to 65. The authorities are trying to lure recently retired soldiers back into service. In an effort to create battle-ready forces much faster than usual, the newly enlisted are being mashed together with serving officers who have not yet deployed and residual equipment from existing brigades, Mr Kofman notes. But generating new units in this way amounts to “selling off the family silver”, says a Western official. The officers and equipment assigned to them would normally be used to train new soldiers or to relieve battle-worn troops. Russia is, in effect, cannibalising its own forces, Mr Kofman says, which will reduce “the overall sustainability of the war effort”.Russia’s shortage of well-trained troops is one reason its advance in Donbas has been glacial. Ukraine, despite a smaller population, has a larger supply of eager recruits. Training them remains a bottleneck, but that could be overcome with a little help: on June 17th Mr Johnson proposed a scheme whereby Britain would train as many as 10,000 soldiers every 120 days.Ukraine is also receiving ever more sophisticated Western weaponry. To begin with, it sought chiefly short-range, portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to fend off advancing armoured columns and marauding helicopters. More recently, however, America, Britain and others have been supplying modern artillery and rockets, which will be much more useful in any counter-attacks. On June 23rd Ukraine’s defence minister said that American himars rocket launchers, with gps-guided munitions, had begun to arrive.Indeed, some Ukrainian officials, including Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, argue that if Western help arrives on a sufficient scale, Ukraine may be able to win the war before winter sets in. A military intelligence officer says that Ukraine’s best window for a counter-offensive will come in late October, when its stock of Western arms should be peaking. “We need the enemy to feel the full force of the weaponry,” he says. There is talk of pushing Russia back to its positions at the start of the war, and then negotiating a peace deal from a position of strength.But this optimism glosses over several yawning pitfalls. For one thing, Ukraine’s forces have used most of their munitions and, without the domestic manufacturing capacity to replenish them, are now completely reliant on foreign benefactors. The recent fighting has centred on long, heavy artillery barrages that consume vast amounts of ammunition. Russia, which has huge stocks, is thought to be blasting away so indiscriminately that America’s entire annual production would be enough to keep its guns firing for only two weeks, observes Alex Vershinin, a retired us Army officer. Even though Ukraine has been trying to ration its consumption, nato countries may struggle to keep it adequately supplied with shells.What is more, Ukraine’s backers have already handed over a big share of their stocks of certain weapons. The 7,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles America has provided, for instance, are thought to amount to about a third of its total inventory. Western armies do not want to let their own supplies run too low; in fact, many of them are hoping to add to them in light of Russia’s aggression.Although America and Europe, with vastly larger economies than Russia, could eventually gear up to produce whatever Ukraine needs, their output of shells and missiles will not double overnight. America produces only 2,100 Javelins a year. Mr Vershinin notes that the number of American small-arms plants has shrunk from five during the Vietnam war to one today.Maintaining all the fancy nato kit is also hard. America and Germany taught Ukrainian soldiers to use their howitzers in a couple of weeks, but learning how to fix them is another matter. The use of artillery pieces is so intense that many have already broken down and have been sent to Poland for repair. This problem will grow as complex weapons like himars arrive and Ukraine gradually moves from Soviet hardware to weapons provided by nato.Perhaps most important is how Ukraine deploys its new arsenal. Many of the weapons that it is getting were designed in the cold war to face down precisely the adversary that Ukraine now faces in Donbas: a Soviet-style army using heavy firepower. The worry in some Western countries is that Ukraine will try to match Russia gun for gun, and so blaze through its ammunition at a prodigious rate. “If you want to use himars as an area weapon,” warned Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, on June 29th, “you’ll be running out of ammunition in 12 hours.”The aim is to encourage Ukraine to use rocket launchers and other long-range systems in line with their original purpose of fighting a “deep battle”: hitting important Russian targets, such as command posts and railway hubs, many kilometres behind the front lines. There is evidence that Ukraine is indeed making a concerted effort to strike deep inside Donbas. Mr Wallace says that five ammunition dumps have recently been blown up, along with a number of Russian headquarters. This offers a path, if not to outright victory, then at least to a standoff that imposes severe costs on Russia. Western officials doubt that Ukraine will be able to take back all the land it has lost since the invasion began. After all, the war has shown how much easier it is to defend than attack, and Russian forces are well dug in. But if Ukraine can be kept supplied with arms and ammunition and uses its new firepower judiciously, it could recapture pockets of territory, sow chaos in Russia’s rear and inflict unsustainable losses in terms of men and materiel on a Russian army that is stretched thin along a huge front.It is not just weapons that Ukraine will need to pursue such a strategy, however; the government is also desperately short of money. The war has smashed its economy: the central bank and the imf reckon that output could shrink by more than a third this year—a blow on a par with the Depression in America in the 1930s. More optimistic analyses hold that it is the occupied regions that are most afflicted, and that activity elsewhere has recovered somewhat after a plunge in March, with the current year-on-year contraction amounting to perhaps 15%. Either way, Ukraine’s public finances have been upended. The government has had to spend lavishly not only on the armed forces, but also to provide humanitarian assistance to the injured, unemployed and displaced—even as it has cut taxes to succour the limping economy. The result is a deficit of about $5bn a month.Under the circumstances, investors are naturally reluctant to lend to Ukraine. Tax rises would be counterproductive, given the atrophy of the economy. The government is trying to cut some spending: it recently curbed unemployment benefits, for example. The West has pledged lots of aid, but it is not arriving fast enough to balance the books. So the government has been reduced to printing money. The central bank has been purchasing government bonds since the invasion began, at an ever accelerating pace (see chart). At the same time it is burning through its foreign reserves in an effort to stabilise the hryvnia. Inflation, already 18%, is rising. Should the West allow the government’s finances to spiral out of control or the economy to cease to function, the military outlook would inevitably darken, too.Russia looks in much better economic shape, by contrast. After a brief wobble brought on by fierce Western sanctions, the rouble has recovered. Fears of a bank run have receded. Although Western firms have pulled out as much of the $300bn or so they have invested in local outlets and factories as they can, and many educated Russians have fled the country, most forecasters expect a relatively manageable contraction this year, thanks in part to heavy government spending. Mr Putin frequently insists that the sanctions hurt the West more than they do Russia.In fact, sanctions are taking a toll, largely by depriving the economy of crucial imports. Car production is down by more than 80% from its pre-invasion level—a reflection, in part, of the difficulty that manufacturers have obtaining parts from abroad, but also of declining consumer demand. In May dealers sold just 26 Porsches in Russia, 95% fewer than the year before. Output of lifts has fallen by half, pointing to a slump in big construction projects.The shortage of critical components is a worry for Russia’s generals, too. “We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators”, Gina Raimondo, America’s commerce secretary, told Congress in May. Although some Russian firms do make computer chips, and are trying to boost output, their wares are more expensive and less sophisticated than imported ones.But relatively few munitions factories seem to be affected so far, Mr Connolly notes, perhaps because Russian defence firms tend to hoard important parts, a hangover from Soviet central planning. What is more, Western sanctions are not watertight and, thanks to its oil revenues, Russia has plenty of money to spend subverting them. The government has been seeking alternative supply chains for some time. A new paper from rusi, a think-tank in Britain, points to “myriad companies based around the world, including in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, India and China, who will take considerable risks to meet Russian supply requirements”. China has signalled willingness to supply spare parts to Russian aircraft firms.Indeed, Mr Putin appears confident that time and money are on his side. Even if Russia’s forces fail to advance rapidly, they have succeeded in blockading Ukraine’s ports, contributing to the strangulation of its economy. And although neither the Russian public nor the elite was eager for war, Mr Putin’s ruthless security forces and energetic propagandists have kept dissent to a minimum. It helps that most of the army’s new recruits—and casualties—appear to come from small towns in poorer provinces, meaning that Russia’s big cities have been shielded from the worst effects of the war. But the lengths to which Mr Putin has gone to avoid a general mobilisation suggest that he is not confident that Russians are willing to put up with a long and bloody war. By the same token, the economic optimism currently displayed by businessmen and the broader population could also evaporate as the longer-term costs of the war, Western sanctions and emigration start to sink in. Many in Ukraine fear that Russia may resort to more ruthless tactics if the war drags on too long for Mr Putin’s comfort. It could, for instance, target the power grid and heating facilities as winter approaches—a move that would impose an enormous humanitarian cost on the general population. Ukrainians seem to be steeling themselves for such privations, however. Data from Rating, a polling agency, show that well over half of them now believe the war will last at least six months, up from 10% in a sample taken in early March. Nonetheless, fully 93% of respondents say Ukraine will prevail in the end, with varying degrees of confidence. “Ukraine has started to believe in itself,” says Alexei Antipovich, Rating’s boss. Ukrainians remain firmly against the idea of negotiations with Russia, with the mood against compromise shifting decisively following the reporting of Russian atrocities in the second half of March. They fear a repeat of the Minsk accords, the French- and German-brokered peace deals that drew new lines in Ukrainian sand but never satiated Russian appetites. Ukraine does not believe the Kremlin will stop at anything other than complete surrender. “We either win or we lose,” says Oleh Zhdanov, a former operational officer at Ukraine’s General Staff.Ukraine’s allies may not take such a black-and-white view of things. Indeed, Mr Putin may find them easier to dishearten than Ukrainians. By slashing exports of gas through the main pipeline from Russia to Germany, he recently signalled that he is willing to take Europe’s economy hostage to advance his war aims. Soaring gas prices and economically crippling shortages over the winter would almost certainly induce some European governments to lean on Ukraine to accept an imperfect truce.Several European countries, most notably Germany, were painfully slow to start giving Ukraine heavy weapons. Many are still reluctant to describe their goal in sending arms as helping Ukraine to “win” the war. There is certainly no unanimity within nato about how to define victory. The longer the war goes on, and the higher the cost in terms of punishing energy prices and decelerating economies, the more reluctant Ukraine’s allies will become to provide endless weapons and cash. Mr Putin, for one, seems to be counting on the West’s resolve to crumble. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""On and on""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Its defences against Western sanctions can only stretch so farBut the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understood"
2,Three scenarios for how war in Ukraine could play out,,14/11/22,"By Shashank Joshi: Defence editor, The EconomistANY SEASONED intelligence analyst might have scoffed had they been told in March 2022 that Ukraine would still be an independent state eight months later; that Ukraine’s army would have killed or wounded 80,000 Russians; that the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet would be at the bottom of that sea; and that Ukraine’s air force would still be flying. Ukraine has defied expectations. It is winning the war. But winter is coming and Russia is mobilising. Consider three scenarios for the year ahead.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.In the first, Russia snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. Russia’s army stabilises the front lines over the winter months, while building new battalions with freshly mobilised recruits. Meanwhile, Republicans in America block new arms packages for Ukraine, as supplies from Europe run out. Russia’s defence industry is starved of semiconductors and specialised equipment, but churns out enough basic armour and artillery to equip the new forces.By the spring, the new Russian units go on the attack, forcing back a Ukrainian force that is weary from months of offensive action. Russian drones continue to hammer Ukraine’s energy and water infrastructure. As summer arrives, Ukraine is on the back foot. Russia captures Kryvyi Rih, a key industrial town north of Kherson, and Slovyansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Western countries urge Ukraine to accept a Russian offer of a ceasefire. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has little choice but to accept. In the months, perhaps years, that follow, Russia assiduously rearms for another attempt on Kyiv.A Putin ultimatum: stop, or face the use of nuclear weaponsFar more likely is a second scenario: stalemate. Russia mobilises hundreds of thousands of young men, but cannot turn them into effective fighters. All the best trainers are on the front lines. Experienced officers are dead or already deployed. The recruits are fashioned into basic light-infantry units, lacking armoured vehicles and unfit to go on the offensive—but able to fill trenches and man fortifications. Russia, having announced a withdrawal from Kherson city in November, safely evacuates the 30,000 or so troops it had on the west bank of the Dnieper river. They retreat east, leaving huge amounts of weaponry behind. It is a triumph for Ukraine, but it ultimately puts Russia in a stronger military position, with the river protecting its left flank. The Ukrainian advance slows to a crawl; Ukrainian troops take heavy casualties for each kilometre of territory won.Unable to win the war on the battlefield, Mr Putin then tries to prolong it long enough to undermine Ukraine’s economy, sap its morale through strikes on civilian infrastructure and exhaust its partners. Europe struggles to fill its gas-storage sites during 2023, causing blackouts as winter arrives. Mr Putin aims to hold out until late 2024, when he hopes Donald Trump will retake the White House and end support for Ukraine. But it is a high-stakes gamble: Russian opinion turns against the war, its economy shrivels and Mr Putin looks ever more vulnerable. The third scenario is the most encouraging—and perhaps the most dangerous. Ukraine keeps the initiative and the momentum, inflicting heavy damage on Russian forces as they leave Kherson and then bringing its long-range HIMARs rockets within range of Crimea for the first time. Russian lines in Luhansk collapse, with Ukraine recapturing Severodonetsk and then quickly moving farther east. As Russian casualties mount, new recruits refuse to fight. Western countries rush new air-defence systems to Ukraine, blunting the impact of Russia’s terror tactics, based on its rapidly dwindling arsenal of precision missiles.In the spring Mr Zelensky orders his army to open a new front in Zaporizhia. Five brigades slice through Russian lines, cutting Mr Putin’s land bridge to Crimea and encircling Mariupol by the summer. Ukraine moves its HIMARs rocket launchers into the south, targeting ports, bases and depots in Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine threatens to enter the peninsula. Mr Putin issues an ultimatum: stop, or face the use of nuclear weapons. Victory is within sight. But so, too, are the risks that it brings.■Shashank Joshi: Defence editor, The EconomistThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “Conflicting possibilities”A global round-up from The Economist Intelligence UnitAs 2023 begins, the world’s most important climate system remains locked in La NiñaOur selection of events around the world"
3,How rare-gas supply adapted to Russia’s war,,30/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warThe war in Ukraine has reconfigured global flows of oil and gas. Less visible has been its impact on another supply chain: that of the so-called rare gases—neon, krypton and xenon—which are used in everything from chipmaking to medicine to space propulsion. Russia and Ukraine have long been big suppliers, accounting for about 40-50% of the global supply of neon before the conflict, and 25-30% of xenon and krypton, according to John Raquet of Spiritus Consulting, an industrial-gas specialist. At times, their share of the supply of neon has been as high as 70%.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Hence the concern, after Russia’s invasion, about disturbance to chipmakers, which use neon in the lasers that etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, and in turn supply other industries. The Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s scientific-advisory body, warned of “severe” disruption, and noted a shortage of neon could “substantially impact industrial supply chains reliant on semiconductors”. Worse, as the war began, the semiconductor industry was seeking to ramp up output to meet post-pandemic demand. A year later, however, it is clear that chaos has been avoided. What went right?Krypton, neon and xenon are by-products of air separation, an industrial process used in steelmaking to extract oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere. This allows the recovery of leftover mixtures, from which the gases can be extracted at specialist purification facilities. In the 1980s the Soviet Union built air-separation plants at steel mills in Russia and Ukraine. Its aim was to produce gases for use in military lasers, to compete with America’s “Star Wars” programme. After the Soviet Union fell, Russia and Ukraine became global suppliers of rare gases. Even after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russian steel mills continued to send rare-gas mixtures to Ukraine for purification.This flow stopped after Russia’s invasion last year. The conflict also affected the operation of steel mills in Ukraine. As a result, rare-gas purifiers in Ukraine have been running at a fraction of full capacity. At the same time, sanctions have limited exports from Russia. The drop in supply caused a surge in wholesale prices, particularly of xenon, which went from $15 a litre in 2020 to more than $100 in mid-2022.In response, chipmakers drew on their rare-gas reserves and invested in technology that enables recycling. Other buyers cut usage or switched to alternatives. Xenon is sometimes used as an anaesthetic, for example, but less so if the price is high, when it is replaced by gases including nitrous oxide. Other gases, such as argon or nitrogen, can be used in place of krypton in triple-glazed windows. Krypton and xenon are used as propellant in satellite thrusters, but the latest Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX now use argon instead.Retrofitting air-separation plants with taps that allow rare-gas mixtures to be extracted is costly and halts production for two or three months. But new plants are being built with the taps installed, which will increase future supply. Meanwhile, Russia diverted exports to China, which then had a surplus, and began exporting its own production. In Japan, says Koizumi Yoshiki, president of Gas Review, an industrial-gas journal, efforts are under way to boost domestic production through a mixture of retrofitting and new plants. South Korea, another chipmaking hub, aims to become self-sufficient in rare gases in the next couple of years, notes Mr Raquet.Collectively, these efforts to reduce consumption and boost supply have stabilised the market. Prices have fallen from their highs; a litre of xenon now costs around $45. Media coverage of the warnings helped, says Dan Hutcheson of TechInsights, a consulting firm. Along with rising prices, it delivered a “one-two punch”, he notes, that spurred companies to take rapid action. At the same time, demand fell. By mid-2022 it was clear that the chip shortage was turning into a glut.Supply chains have been reinforced and suppliers diversified, meaning the rare-gas industry is now much less vulnerable to geopolitical risk. Companies of all kinds have been paying more attention to their supply chains lately, in response to upsets caused by trade disputes, covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. Firms make the headlines when they fail to cope with disruption. As the rare-gas industry shows, few people notice when they succeed. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Bright lights""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Regulators arrange a deal for the California-based lenderThat is the popular narrative.

4,How many Russians have been killed in Ukraine?,,08/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war here.NEARLY 1,200 Russian soldiers were recently killed in a single day around Bakhmut, according to Mark Milley, America’s top general, in an interview with Politico, a news website. “That’s Iwo Jima,” he reflected, referring to a brutal 36-day Pacific battle during the second world war. “That’s Shiloh”—a battle in the American civil war. A recently published paper offers a new assessment of the extraordinary losses Russia is facing in Ukraine (see chart).The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think-tank in Washington, says that Russia is likely to have suffered 60,000 to 70,000 combat fatalities in the first year of its invasion, citing American and other Western officials, as well as public reports. Our chart depicts the central estimate in that range. Including those killed, wounded and missing, total casualty numbers swell to 200,000 to 250,000. Calculating such things is a highly uncertain business. But the CSIS tally is only a little higher than Western government estimates that draw on intelligence. Stratospheric Russian casualties are unsurprising. Russia’s initial blitzkrieg in February 2022 failed, and the conflict has since turned into a war of attrition: huge volumes of shellfire continue to pound forces on each side. In its quest to capture the eastern city of Bakhmut, which is teetering, Russia sent waves of conscripts and prisoners to fight. They have been mown down in large numbers. For two weeks in late January and early February, as Russia intensified its attacks across eastern Ukraine, its casualties probably reached over 800 per day, killed and wounded, according to British defence intelligence.This level of carnage far exceeds what Russia has faced in any of its modern conflicts. It lost 95 to 185 soldiers per month in Chechnya between 1999 and 2009 and 130 to 145 soldiers per month in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. In Ukraine it has seen 5,000 to 5,800 military deaths (including mercenaries) per month. The number of Russian soldiers killed in the past year probably exceeds the death toll in every other Russian and Soviet conflict since 1945, combined. Its casualties are dwarfed only by the second world war, in which the Soviet Union lost more than 8m men. Russia’s severe losses forced it to conduct a mobilisation drive in September but it has largely frittered away those forces. It could launch another wave of mobilisation, though that would come with political risks. Already, two-thirds of Russians know someone who has been mobilised or is fighting in the war. Moreover, the troops killed in 2022 were many of Russia’s best young officers and most experienced soldiers. The men who replace them will have less training, discipline and skill. Nor will they have the same quality of equipment. When American intelligence officials briefed Congress on Russian preparations for war last year, they suggested that 25,000 to 50,000 Ukrainian civilians might die. The true total has been considerably smaller: at least 8,000 confirmed civilian deaths, according to the UN. The officials also estimated that Russia would lose 3,000 to 10,000 military personnel—a range that reflected expectations of a relatively short conventional war. They could not have imagined that Russia would immolate an entire army in the space of a year.■The influx of grain is testing its neighbours’ solidarityThe rise of domestic cinema counters Western cultural influenceThe extremists are becoming more deadly.

5,Russia’s war is creating corporate winners and losers,,19/03/22,"MOST MULTINATIONAL companies can live without Russian customers. Living without Russian commodities would be much harder. On March 15th the European Commission announced new economic constraints on Russia, including a ban on exports of European luxury items and cars—the definition of an essential good is, after all, in the eye of the oligarch. But the announcement also included a ban on steel products from Russia. More such restrictions on Russian exports may come.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Companies are struggling to contain the fallout of Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine. The first response of those with business in Russia was to rush for the exit. About 400 have announced their withdrawal from Russia, according to one tally, cowed by legal and reputational risks. Executives now face a different, bigger challenge. This concerns not their business within Russia but supply chains that extend beyond it, and other knock-on effects. As the war continues, it is creating corporate winners and losers, as well as an awful lot of volatility.There are two factors that make the shock to supply chains particularly difficult for firms to manage. The first is the breadth of commodities produced by Ukraine and Russia. The two countries together supply 26% of the world’s exports of wheat, 16% of corn, 30% of barley and about 80% of sunflower oil and sunflower-seed meal. Ukraine provides about half the world’s neon, used to etch microchips. Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer, second-largest producer of gas and top exporter of nickel, used in car batteries, and palladium, used in car-exhaust systems, not to mention a large exporter of aluminium and iron. Even without formal sanctions on most of Russia’s commodities, Western traders are increasingly trying to avoid them, wary of legal risks.The second complicating factor is the market’s extraordinary swings. The price of Brent crude surged to $128 a barrel on March 8th, then dipped below $100 a week later as China announced new covid-19 restrictions and investors anticipated the interest-rate increase by America’s Federal Reserve on March 16th. The London Metal Exchange halted trading of nickel on March 8th after its price shot past a record $100,000 a tonne. When trading resumed on March 16th, a technical issue prompted the exchange to suspend trading once more (see Finance & economics section).The overall American stockmarket is back roughly to where it was before the invasion. But a few industries benefit from the turmoil, from armsmakers to cable news and the lawyers who help firms comply with sanctions. The biggest winners are commodities firms, especially outside Russia (see chart).A stockmarket index of American frackers, which benefit from high oil prices and European demand for liquefied natural gas, climbed by a fifth between February 23rd and March 10th. It remains 9% above its pre-invasion level, despite the decline in oil prices. Mining firms are, as a group, likewise performing well, buoyed by higher metals prices, as are steelmakers (except Russian ones). The share prices of US Steel and Tata Steel, with headquarters in Pittsburgh and Mumbai, respectively, have climbed by 38% and 11% since the eve of the invasion. Bunge and ADM, two big listed traders that specialise in rerouting flows of grain, have outperformed the market, too.The war does not affect all commodities firms equally. Rio Tinto, a big miner, announced on March 10th that it would abandon a joint venture with Rusal, a giant Russian aluminium producer. Rocketing electricity costs resulting from the soaring price of natural gas, 40% of which Europe gets from Russia, have forced some Spanish steelmakers to cut output.Pricey inputs are a more widespread problem for sectors further up the value chain. Just as they were preparing to lift off as pandemic travel restrictions are relaxed, airlines got slapped with rising fuel costs. Yara International, a Norwegian fertiliser-maker, said on March 9th that the cost of natural gas had prompted it to cut production at two European factories.Carmakers, which have not yet recovered from the pandemic’s disruptions to supply chains, face fresh problems. Volkswagen and BMW, two German giants, have cut production in Europe as they seek out new manufacturers of the harnesses that bundle miles of electrical wires in their cars to replace out-of-action Ukrainian suppliers. Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons that the 67% jump in nickel prices before trading stopped represented an increase of about $1,000 to the input costs of the average American electric vehicle.Gabriel Adler of Citigroup, another bank, notes that carmakers have so far been successful in passing their costs on to consumers. Tesla, America’s electric-car superstar, this month raised prices; Elon Musk, its boss, complained in a tweet about “significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics”. Such pricing power is enviable. But it has its limits. At some point people will not be willing to absorb any further increases.In certain cases, consumers are beginning to balk. American food firms have been raising prices for months to offset higher costs of energy, transport and ingredients. However, they have been unable to raise them quickly enough to protect margins. The need to negotiate prices with grocers limits their ability to demand higher ones whenever they desire. And grocers, in turn, are under pressure from shoppers. Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse, one more bank, notes that consumers have in the past year been willing to stomach pricier food. But the war’s impact on commodities prices comes at a moment when their patience is wearing thin, especially in America, where inflation has hit a 40-year high.“Every food company must be getting a little nervous that they are pushing the consumer too far,” says Mr Moskow. As the costs of inputs continue to climb, it looks increasingly likely that companies will be forced to choose between compressing profits and depressing demand. ■Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline ""Value-chain reaction""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Meet the winners from America’s consumer slowdownLess important for some, vital for othersDealmaking is the new digging"
6,"How, if at all, might Russia be punished for its war crimes in Ukraine?",,04/04/22,"Russian troops retreating from Kyiv have left behind a landscape of atrocities. The mayor of Motyzhyn, a suburb of the capital, was found blindfolded and shot, apparently by Russian forces, along with her family. An eye witness told Human Rights Watch, a charity, that Russian soldiers threw a smoke grenade into a basement in Vorzel, near Irpin, then shot a woman and her child as they emerged into the light. Another saw soldiers round up five men in nearby Bucha, forced to kneel and pull their shirts over their heads, and shoot one in the head before 40 witnesses. In all, said Ukraine’s prosecutor-general on April 3rd, 410 civilians had been killed around Kyiv. Many more will be found.The renewed evidence of Russian atrocities has produced renewed condemnation. “Genocide”, Ukraine’s president and Poland’s prime minister called it. The American president, Joe Biden, said what had happened in Bucha was a war crime and that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, should face an international tribunal for it. The un secretary general asked for another investigation (several are already under way), and Ukraine said it would set one up with the eu. The former un chief prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda demanded that an international arrest warrant be issued against Mr Putin. For its part, Russia said the whole thing was faked, then blamed the Ukrainians for it, demanding a un Security Council meeting to discuss the “heinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha”. It is possible there were or will be atrocities by Ukrainian forces, though not on the same scale. But Ukraine will, presumably, investigate them, unlike Russia. In this particular case, the decomposition of the victims’ bodies shows they had been killed long before Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha.The evidence from the battlefield confirms that Russians have committed at least three types of criminal offence in war. The first are war crimes. The Geneva Conventions, which Russia has signed, define war crimes to include wilful killing, wilfully causing great suffering, deliberately targeting civilians and destroying or appropriating property. Summary executions at Bucha would be war crimes. So would the bombing of the Mariupol theatre which was the city’s largest air-raid shelter and had the Russian word for children written in letters large enough to be seen from the sky. The Geneva Conventions determine what are international legal obligations in all military actions. It does not matter that Russia has not formally declared war in Ukraine.Second, Russia’s invasion was itself a crime, regardless of the way in which it has been carried out. It is a crime of aggression. This is spelled out in the statutes of the International Criminal Court (icc), which tries individuals for actions under international law. The icc defines aggression to include invasion, military occupation, the annexation of land, bombardment, the blockade of ports and other actions that contradict the UN charter. Lastly, the scale of the Russian actions around Kyiv (and elsewhere) strongly suggests that Russia is guilty of crimes against humanity. The icc defines this as participation in and knowledge of “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed and over 4m driven abroad.Proceedings have begun in several international courts to bring the perpetrators to justice. Two have made initial rulings in Ukraine’s favour. In the first, on March 16th, the International Court of Justice (icj), which adjudicates on inter-state disputes, ruled that Russia “shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced” on February 24th. The issue before the court seemed arcane: Ukraine said Russia’s argument that it had launched an invasion to prevent a Ukrainian genocide in Russian-speaking breakaway regions was bogus under the un’s genocide convention. The significance of the ruling was not just that the court agreed with Ukraine, but that it broadened its conclusion to demand Russia’s full withdrawal.The other ruling came at the European Court of Human Rights, which is part of the Council of Europe, a governmental human-rights body. On April 1st it confirmed an earlier ruling that Russia must “refrain from military attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including…schools and hospitals.” Ukraine had brought the case under European human-rights laws. The court added that Russia had acted wrongly when it forced refugees from Mariupol to flee to Russia, rather than to a place of their own choosing.But it is one thing to make rulings, another to bring to an international court any Russian, let alone its head of state. Russia was thrown out of the Council of Europe on March 16th because of the invasion and has stopped responding to the European court’s demands. Since 2016, the country has not recognised the authority of the icc, either. That does not rule out the icc prosecutor bringing a case or issuing arrest warrants against individual Russians. But if Russia ignores the warrant, the next step would be to refer the case to the UN Security Council - and Russia could then use its veto. Russia does accept the authority of the other international court, the icj, at least in theory. In practice, though, it did not show up at the court’s hearings and (obviously) has ignored its ruling. As with the icc, the only way of enforcing icj rulings is through the un Security Council. If Mr Putin remains in power, therefore, or even if he resigns but continues to be protected by successors, international justice will not be seen to be done.Legal proceedings will grind on and are likely to deal further setbacks to Russia’s legal case and diplomatic standing. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s allies will have to find other means of stepping up pressure on Mr Putin. These include more sanctions and more lethal weapons to Ukraine.Even before the horrors revealed by Russia’s retreat from Kyiv, nato allies had started to offer heavier weapons. The New York Times reported on April 1st that the Biden administration planned to transfer Soviet-made T-72 tanks to bolster Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. These would be the first tanks provided to Ukraine by America, which had previously insisted its military aid was purely defensive. On March 16th Britain started to provide the Ukrainians with its advanced Starstreak anti-aircraft missile; on April 1st a video showed a Starstreak apparently bringing down a Russian helicopter. Other advanced weaponry seems likely to be on offer soon. So is another round of sanctions, the fifth in all.Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, made up of heads of government of eu countries, says more sanctions are “on their way”. They will include easy ones, such as closing loopholes, imposing more restrictions on individual oligarchs, banning Russian ships from eu ports and more fully isolating Russian banks cut off from the swift international payments system. But this time the eu could also include embargoes on energy supplies, something long demanded by Mr Zelensky but resisted by gas-importing eu states. The defence minister of Germany, Europe’s largest gas buyer, called for the eu to discuss banning imported Russian gas. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, went further and said he would support banning all Russian oil and coal coming into the eu, a position also taken by the leader of a junior partner in the Italian government. Like Germany, Italy is dependent on Russian energy. Further energy restrictions are already coming into force: on April 3rd Lithuania became the first eu country to ban imports of Russian gas. Russia’s war crimes seem to have stiffened resolve among Ukraine’s Western allies. They seem to be saying, in the words of Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, “We can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalise this.” ■Editor’s note: This story was updated on April 5th to make clearer that Russia is unable to prevent war-crimes charges being brought by the ICC, though it could then stymie subsequent actions.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.It has transformed crime not only in Russia and Ukraine, but around the worldSudan is not a one-off.

7,"What is hybrid war, and is Russia waging it in Ukraine?",,22/02/22,"IN 2014 MYSTERIOUS “little green men” without military insignia emerged in Crimea, and wrested the peninsula from Ukraine with hardly a shot being fired. Soon after, in eastern Ukraine, a motley collection of armed thugs and Russian forces took over enclaves in the region of Donbas, claiming to seek independence. These events, and many of the murky actions attributed to Russia since then—from cyber-attacks to assassinations abroad, meddling in elections in the West, and now the threat of invasion—have been labelled as forms of “hybrid war”. What does the term mean and how has it evolved? Subterfuge and surprise are as old as warfare itself. “The Art of War”, a treatise thought to date to the 5th century BC and attributed to Sun Tzu, declares that “to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill”. The modern concept of hybrid war was popularised by Frank Hoffman, a former US Marine and a defence scholar, in a paper from 2007 analysing chaotic conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, in which tactics changed and the line between civilians and combatants was blurred. (He, in turn, attributed the term to another writer’s master’s thesis from 1998.) Mr Hoffman wrote: “Hybrid Wars incorporate a range of different modes of warfare, including conventional capabilities, irregular tactics and formations, terrorist acts including indiscriminate violence and coercion, and criminal disorder.” This variety of actions could be the work of the same actor.He was thinking mainly of insurgent groups and weak states such as Iran. Hizbullah, an Iranian-sponsored Shia militia-cum-party in Lebanon, is one archetype of the hybrid combatant. To the extent that Mr Hoffman mentioned Russia, a powerful state, it was to cite its experience of fighting hybrid insurgents in Chechnya. In his view, hybrid war is essentially a form of asymmetric warfare, in which a combatant seeks to avoid the strengths of a more powerful adversary. Russian strategists, for their part, speak of “non-linear warfare”, a term popularised in a dystopian short story by one of Mr Putin’s closest advisers, Vladislav Surkov, to mean a chaotic conflict of “all against all”. Another presumed godfather of unconventional methods is General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s armed-forces chief. In an article in 2013, he wrote: “In the 21st century we have seen a tendency toward blurring the lines between the states of war and peace. Wars are no longer declared and, having begun, proceed according to an unfamiliar template.” These words, written a year before Russia deployed its “little green men” in Crimea, came to be seen as prophetic. Except that General Gerasimov was applying the idea to the West, which he blamed for fomenting the Arab spring of 2011 and “colour revolutions” in Russia’s periphery. A prosperous state, he noted, “in a matter of months and even days can turn into an arena of fierce armed struggle, become a victim of foreign intervention, plunge into the abyss of chaos, humanitarian catastrophe and civil war.” Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia, coined the idea of a “Gerasimov doctrine” but now regrets it. Russia’s methods, he argues, involve a mix of two sorts of “non-linear” war. The first involves the realisation “that modern technologies and modern societies mean that a shooting war will likely be preceded by and maybe even almost, but not quite, replaced by a phase of political destabilisation.” The second form is a contest short of actual war, in which Russia seeks to divide, demoralise and distract the West so that it cannot stop Russia’s attempt to re-establish a sphere of interest.If Mr Hoffman’s original definition of hybrid warfare involved the mixing of different forms of actual fighting, over time “hybrid” has been used loosely to refer to lots of non-lethal forms of attack and subversion, eg, “hybrid actions” or “hybrid threats”. The European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki, established in 2017 jointly by NATO and the European Union, described such actions as “characterised by ambiguity as hybrid actors blur the usual borders of international politics and operate in the interfaces between external and internal, legal and illegal, and peace and war.” Elisabeth Braw of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, prefers a different taxonomy which draws the line at military action. She categorises acts below this threshold as “grey-zone aggression”, which she defines as “the use of hostile acts outside the realm of armed conflict to weaken a rival country, entity or alliance”. If these are mixed in with actual combat then they become hybrid warfare. “It has become fashionable to use hybrid war for anything that is a bit mysterious,” she argues, “In fact, every war is now hybrid because it has both military and non-military dimensions, such as propaganda and cyber.” Yet the grey-zone aspect is becoming more prominent because globalisation and interconnections offer many options for sowing chaos. It often comes with lower risk of retribution—in a cyber-attack, say, the perpetrator can be hard to identify conclusively. In this light, the West’s response in publicising Russia’s military build-up, releasing intelligence on its plans for false-flag and other operations to create a pretext for war, is in itself a grey-zone response intended to cause confusion in the Kremlin. So how to characterise what is going on in Ukraine? For Ms Braw, the intensified fighting along the “line of control” between Ukrainian forces and separatists is “hybrid war”. Russia’s intimidation and subversion of the rest of Ukraine—including the threat of invasion that rattles confidence and weakens Ukraine’s economy—still counts as “grey-zone aggression”. If Mr Putin decides his menaces are not enough and orders his tanks into combat, it becomes “hybrid war”—or perhaps just plain “war”.For more stories on the potential for, and possible impact of, conflict in eastern Europe, visit our hubMore from The Economist explains:Why Donetsk and Luhansk are at the heart of the Ukraine crisisHow big is Russia’s military build-up around Ukraine?What did Ukraine’s revolution in 2014 achieve?The Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
8,Moldova is trying to stay out of Russia’s war with Ukraine,,03/05/22,"Your browser does not support the <audio> element.MAIA SANDU, Moldova’s slight, soft-spoken, pro-European president, seems a bit out of place in her country’s vast presidential palace. Originally the home of Moldova’s Supreme Soviet, it was built in the waning days of the Soviet Union to advertise the government’s authority in the second smallest of its 15 constituent republics. When the union collapsed and Moldova became independent, Russia backed a separatist rebellion in Transnistria, a mostly Russian-speaking region; up to a thousand people were killed. Russian troops remain (illegally) in the breakaway statelet, over which the Moldovan government has no control. Now Russia’s attempt to re-establish the Soviet order in Ukraine is threatening to spark fresh conflict in Moldova, already one of Europe’s poorest countries. This, says Ms Sandu in an interview with The Economist, is the most dangerous moment in Moldova’s history since its birth in 1991-92. The most obvious threat is military. Russia has threatened to extend the war to Moldova’s eastern border with Ukraine. On April 22nd Rustam Minnekaev, a Russian general, declared that control over southern Ukraine would open up a route to Transnistria, where, he claimed, Russian-speakers were being oppressed. That set alarm bells ringing in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital. “These were worrying words,” says Ms Sandu, “after we’ve seen what is happening in Ukraine.”The worry deepened three days later when an explosion damaged the Russian-controlled state security ministry in Tiraspol, the Transnistrian separatists’ self-proclaimed capital. The day after that, two more explosions wrecked antennas used to transmit Russian radio in the nearby town of Maiac (see map). No one has claimed responsibility for either event, but Russia has a history of mounting “false-flag” operations that can be used to justify military assaults. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, declared that the explosions were the work of Moscow. Ukrainian military intelligence, operating in Transnistria, says it has uncovered large stocks of leaflets urging Russian-speakers there to rise up.Moldova is peculiarly vulnerable. Unlike Ukraine or Georgia, it has never applied to join NATO. Membership of the alliance, to which the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania already belong, might deter Russia. But trying to join now would be seen as provocative. “The moment we ask, the bombs could start to fall,” says a Moldovan official. Informal warnings “not to overdo things” have been arriving from Russia since the summer, and in recent weeks the language has become sharper, says another official. Moldova has neutrality written into its constitution of 1994 for precisely that reason. As things stand, there is little NATO can do little to stop Russia from dragging Moldova into the conflict should it choose to. “We are trying to do our best to keep the country out of the war. But neutrality doesn’t provide 100% [protection],” says Ms Sandu.Nor can Moldova do much to protect itself. Its tiny army has no combat planes or helicopters; its only tanks are antiques on display as memorials of the second world war. Happily, a full-scale invasion does not seem imminent. To reinforce the small garrison in Transnistria Russian forces would need to advance almost 200km westwards across Ukraine from the current front lines. Other dangers are that the perhaps 1,500 Russian soldiers (most of them in fact Transnistrians with Russian passports) stationed in the breakaway statelet could cause trouble in the rest of Moldova, or attack Ukraine from the west. Both would be hard for a poorly equipped force, but there are concerns that May 9th, when Vladimir Putin is to make his “Victory Day” speech in Moscow, may be a trigger point.Advancing on Moldova from the east is a tall order. Despite repeated offensives Russia has not managed to take Mykolaiv, a city on the western edge of the Ukrainian territory it currently controls. Even if it managed that, it would need either to bypass or to take Odessa, a big port city. Odessa is so well defended that life there is returning almost to normal, apart from a night-time curfew and the occasional rocket. Bypassing Odessa would expose Russian units to the risk of being cut off.But invasion is not the biggest challenge on President Sandu’s mind. A more immediate threat is Russian-engineered social and economic strife that could plunge Moldova into chaos. Ms Sandu is a former World Bank adviser and a dedicated and effective corruption-fighter. Her election in 2020 was a forceful rebuke of the Kremlin’s kleptocratic model of governance. The man she defeated, Igor Dodon, was strongly anti-Western and pro-Russian, and one year earlier had fired Ms Sandu as prime minister for her forceful attempts to tackle corruption. He now leads the main opposition bloc in parliament.Russia has a chokehold on Moldova in two ways. First, it supplies almost all of the gas that Moldova relies on to keep its people warm and its modest industries functioning. Gas prices have risen by 380% in less than ten months, according to the president. The main pipelines into Moldova pass through Transnistria,, adding another pressure pointSecond, and yet more seriously, roughly 80% of Moldova’s electricity comes from generators in Transnistria, also powered by Russian gas. The power company, which is Russian-owned, has greatly increased its prices and refused to give Moldova long-term contracts, forcing the government to negotiate for power on a rolling basis. The country’s lights would have gone out on May 1st had the government not managed to secure a contract, for a single month, from Transnistria.Higher energy prices are causing huge problems in such a poor country. The government has tried to cushion the blow with subsidies for the neediest. But it risks going bust as a result. Ms Sandu’s government has appealed to the EU for emergency assistance of €300m ($315m) to tide it over until the end of the year. That is not much for the EU, but it has not yet been forthcoming. Moldova will enjoy more energy security once new power lines to Romania are built, but that is a couple of years away. Russian-leaning governments in the past did nothing to reduce their country’s energy dependence on Moscow.The pro-Russian opposition intends to make use of the crisis. “Russian political forces in Moldova have been already talking about massive protests and have been calling for the government to step down and to have snap parliamentary elections, so they can blame [economic hardship and high energy prices] on the government,” Ms Sandu says. Forcing a snap election will be hard if the government resists it. But big protests could force the state to take unpleasant measures to preserve public order, she fears.As well as money, Ms Sandu is appealing to the EU to show political solidarity, even if direct military support from NATO is not currently an option. A week after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th Moldova applied to join the EU, having held back in the past as part of its efforts to stay neutral. The government promptly answered the list of 366 questions it was sent, Ms Sandu says, only to be hit with another questionnaire, this one with 2,000 queries. Its tiny civil service is wading through it.Actual membership would take many years, as the government well knows. But merely being recognised as a candidate would send a signal to Moldovans, to the EU and to Russia that the country belongs in the West. The window might not stay open for long. “The EU is the place which can provide safety and help save us as a democratic country,” says Ms Sandu.Even candidacy has its risks. Ukraine’s drive for an association agreement with the EU (a lesser category than full membership) was one of the triggers for Russia’s annexation of Crimea and occupation of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. But Russian aggression is forcing Moldova, like others, to get off the fence.■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""The next target?""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
9,Ukraine’s military success is reshaping Russia as well as the war,,06/10/22,"“RUSSIA, RUSSIA, Russia,” chanted Vladimir Putin on September 30th, as he announced the annexation of four Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. But within hours his newly expanded country began shrinking. The Ukrainian army smashed through Russia’s left and right flanks, at the two extremes of a vast front stretching from the Black Sea in the south to the Donbas region in the east (see map). “Not since the initial part of Operation Barbarossa in the second world war has the Russian army had such a terrible series of reverses on the battlefield,” says Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The war is by no means over. Russia still occupies some 15% of Ukrainian territory. Its army will soon swell as the forced mobilisation of some 300,000 reservists announced last month gathers pace. But for the first time in seven months of war, time and momentum are on Ukraine’s side. On October 1st Ukrainian tanks rolled into Lyman, a strategic hub in Donetsk. Later that evening six Ukrainian battalions pierced enemy lines 200 miles (320km) away, in the northern part of Kherson. By the time Russian soldiers were making appeals for emergency air support via social media, the Ukrainians had advanced at least 12 miles. “The enemy has superiority in everything,” wrote Igor Girkin, who led Russia’s first invasion of Donbas, in 2014, “even using aviation.” By October 6th Russian forces had fallen even farther back towards the city of Kherson.In Donbas (which comprises the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk), Ukraine is tantalisingly close to routing its enemy. It is bearing down on weak Russian defensive lines near the towns of Kreminna and Svatove in northern Luhansk. A member of Ukraine’s military intelligence predicts that Russia will soon be forced to retreat from Kreminna to save artillery and other equipment. Svatove is an equally important target, as the site of large ammunition stores and a gateway to the rest of Luhansk. Pushing the Russians back to the lines that existed before the start of the current fighting in February would not be difficult after taking the town, the source said.The battle for Kherson is even more significant. The province forms one end of a “land bridge” linking the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, to Russia. It is also the source of much of Crimea’s water. The city of Kherson is one of Ukraine’s main ports on the Black Sea, and the gateway to the others; the loss of it puts all Ukraine’s maritime trade in jeopardy.Mr Putin has reportedly insisted that his generals hold Kherson city at all costs. Ukraine has been exploiting this stubbornness by destroying bridges and so pinning Russian troops down in what appear to be indefensible positions with their backs against the Dnieper river. The Russian forces there are now in danger of encirclement with no obvious way to retreat. Surrender may be their only option.After a long stalemate over the summer, the war has acquired a sudden fluidity. “Ukraine is dictating the operational tempo at the moment,” says a Western official. Ukrainian generals believe they can achieve more victories in the three-to-four weeks before Russia’s newly mobilised soldiers begin to appear in force. “We can get a lot done in that time—and by that I mean liberating Kherson or northern Luhansk,” says the military source. “When the mobilised guys join the battle, we will be so prepared it will be like pouring water on red-hot metal. They will simply evaporate.”But Ukraine’s onslaught may soon slow down. Its army has been on the offensive for over a month, devouring ammunition and exhausting troops. Winter is coming. As the ground grows wetter and muddier, heavy armoured vehicles will be confined to roads. That tends to disadvantage attackers, as Russia found in the bogs north of Kyiv in March. It also impedes armies like Ukraine’s, with many wheeled, rather than tracked, vehicles. Bad weather makes it harder to use drones to spot targets for artillery, too. Combat operations will therefore “freeze” around the beginning of November, says Pekka Toveri, a former chief of Finnish military intelligence. Yet, even if ground offensives stop, Ukraine will use its American-supplied HIMARS missiles to hammer Russian barracks and depots. Recent videos on social media, the Western official notes, show shivering Russian recruits lighting fires in fields at night in sub-zero temperatures: “That is not going to be a situation where you have high morale over the winter.” Another video shows reservists from the Omsk region asking when they will be paid; local officials reply that they do not have the funds.Ukrainian troops, in contrast, have been given ample cold-weather gear by nato countries and domestic donors. They also have more night-vision goggles, allowing them to take advantage of shorter days. The result may be that Russian forces are run ragged by spring. Mr Putin might nevertheless hope to grind out a victory through sheer mass, exploiting Russia’s three-to-one advantage over Ukraine in fighting-age men. Newly mobilised recruits will be used to relieve forces that have not had a rest for seven months. They could also bring depleted battalions up to strength and, eventually, create new units to go back on the offensive. Christopher Dougherty, a former Pentagon planner now at CNAS, a think-tank, says the war is testing whether a relatively small army using “information-age tech” can defeat a much bigger force with tactics from the “industrial era”.Some European officials worry that Russia will manage to create lots of basic infantry units that could, at the very least, man defensive positions. But most doubt that Russia can train, equip and supply hundreds of thousands of fresh troops. It has large reserves of Soviet-era equipment, says General Toveri, “but luckily most of it is crap.” Two-thirds of those stocks have been stored in the open, he adds, and the rest cannibalised for parts. The new recruits may prove little more than “human speed bumps”, says General Ryan. Even if Mr Putin’s reservists cannot turn the tide, can they stave off defeat, thereby turning the war into a contest of political and economic attrition? After losing Kharkiv province in September, Russia attacked Ukrainian dams and power stations. That Russia has fired very few precision missiles in recent months suggests that its stockpiles are “either depleted or at minimal levels”, says Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst. But it could make life even more miserable for ordinary Ukrainians. And the longer the war, the greater the damage to Ukraine’s economy, which is expected to contract by 35% this year. In addition to attempting to batter Ukraine into submission, Russia might also still hope to peel off some of its Western backers. European officials suspect that the attacks on the two Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea on September 26th were carried out by Russia as a warning that it could strike at other pipelines, compounding Europe’s energy crisis. Mr Putin’s repeated hints at the use of nuclear weapons are also meant to intimidate.Yet Ukraine’s advances in Luhansk and Kherson have not yet prompted escalation. Nor have there been unusual movements of nuclear forces. “We haven’t seen any changes in their nuclear posture,” noted Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, shortly after Mr Putin’s speech. What is more, the main weapon Mr Putin has deployed against Europe so far—a throttling of gas exports—seems to have misfired. Europe’s gas shortage remains serious, but its governments have promised to spend some $500bn to insulate citizens from price spikes. The continent’s gas storage is more than 89% filled, which is above average for this time of year. A new terminal for gas imports has already opened in the Netherlands; two more are due to open in Germany later this year.Western public opinion is even warming towards the war. In late September 74% of Germans told pollsters they favoured maintaining support for Ukraine “despite our rising energy prices”, up from 70% in July. A plurality—and majorities among supporters of each of the parties in the ruling coalition—even supported sending tanks, something which the German government has resisted. Another recent survey shows that the share of Americans concerned that support for Ukraine might lead to a war with Russia has declined from 49% in May to 32% in September. The eu is finalising another round of sanctions on Russia, including an oil-price cap—a step previously resisted by several members. Critically, Western arms are still flowing to Ukraine. On October 4th America announced its latest consignment, including four more HIMARS launchers, 16 howitzers and GPS-guided artillery rounds that surpass anything in Russia’s arsenal. France and Denmark are in talks to send Ukraine as many as a dozen new CAESAR howitzers.In fact, the question is not so much nato’s will to support Ukraine, but its capacity. The current offensives are consuming ammunition at a prodigious rate. In some cases, the barrels of Ukrainian artillery pieces have melted from overuse. A European official warns that supplies will inevitably dwindle after six months or so—just at the point when fresh Russian units may be entering the war. But whatever the practical constraints, the war has prompted a profound shift in the West’s view of Ukraine that diminishes Mr Putin’s chances of sowing division. In February Ukraine was widely seen as a typically corrupt former Soviet state that would inevitably get thumped by Russia. By June it was officially welcomed as a candidate for membership of the European Union. The spectacular success of Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv proved that it could best Russia on the battlefield. The proportion of Germans who think that Ukraine will win the war rose from 26% in August to 42% in September. NATO officers who once questioned whether Ukraine’s soldiers would make good use of the alliance’s weapons now laud their tactics.Meanwhile, Russia’s defeats on the battlefield are causing rifts within Mr Putin’s circle. Two close henchmen, Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord who runs Chechnya, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, who heads a mercenary force called Wagner Group, have launched a synchronised public attack on Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, and the officers they command. The general who failed to hold Lyman, said Mr Kadyrov on October 1st, “should be sent to the front lines to wash off his shame with blood.” Senior members of the Duma, Russia’s parliament, have joined the criticism.There are growing signs of dissent within the broader populace, too. Alla Pugacheva, the most famous pop diva of the Soviet era, took to Instagram to lament “our boys dying for illusory goals”. The mobilisation of reservists was dubbed “mogilisation” on social media. (Mogila is Russian for ”grave”.) It prompted widespread protests and arson attacks against military recruitment centres, especially in the poor areas dominated by ethnic minorities that have furnished a disproportionate share of Russia’s troops. In Dagestan, a largely Muslim region of some 3m people, women rallied repeatedly against the conscription of more of their sons and brothers.That Mr Putin, in annexing parts of Ukraine after fake plebiscites, seemed to be endorsing regional separatism and self-determination, is not lost on such places. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has tried to rally Russia’s minorities against the war. In a video filmed in front of a memorial to Imam Shamil, who fought against the Russian conquest of the Caucasus in the 19th century, he pleads, “Peoples of the Caucasus! All peoples on the territory of Russia! You have no reason to be among these many who still serve the one who wants this war. You do not have to die in Ukraine. Your sons do not have to die in Ukraine. You have no such obligation. Not to your parents, not to your children, not to your future, not to the future of your land.”On October 4th associates of Alexei Navalny, a jailed opposition leader, announced they were re-activating their network around Russia, which had been banned by the Kremlin as an extremist organisation. They called on supporters to join the anti-war effort by any means possible, from distributing leaflets to torching enlistment offices.But the anti-mobilisation protests have already died down, thanks in part to harsh policing. In a country where tolerance for any criticism of the government is evaporating, the main form of dissent is foot-dragging. The mobilisation has prompted a mass exodus. More than 200,000 men have fled to Kazakhstan, another 70,000 to Georgia. Some 66,000 have taken refuge in the eu, despite the decision by Latvia and Estonia to shut their borders to Russian draft-dodgers.This flight, in turn, will exacerbate Russia’s economic problems. Only 25% of Russians have passports. Those leaving are relatively educated and wealthy urbanites. Hundreds of thousands more are hiding from the draft inside the country, having left their jobs and their home addresses. These middle managers, bureaucrats and office clerks are mainstays both of the government and private enterprise.Before the mobilisation, Vladislav Inozemtsev, an economist, was expecting the economy to shrink by about 5% this year; he now expects twice as big a contraction. The government’s accounts are looking sickly, too. It has swung from a big monthly surplus at the start of the war to a nagging deficit, as expenditures have risen and revenues have shrunk (see chart).The cumulative effect of all this is to call into question Mr Putin’s popular support. He previously enjoyed the backing not only of militant nationalists, but the bulk of ordinary Russians, on whom the war in Ukraine was having little impact. The mobilisation has both split that coalition and undermined Mr Putin’s reputation for competence.There is no sign of any immediate threat to Mr Putin’s rule, although Moscow is rife with rumours of impending martial law and border closures. Fatalistic acceptance is widespread, just as it was during the pandemic, when perhaps 1m Russians perished without any uproar. But a businessman describes a growing sense of his vulnerability by quoting from “The Jungle Book”, a classic British children’s novel that is apparently a favourite of Mr Putin: “When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.” Even if that proves wishful thinking, no one would have said it a few months ago. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""Putin at bay""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Its defences against Western sanctions can only stretch so farBut the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understood"
10,Russia’s Orthodox Church paints the conflict in Ukraine as a holy war,,21/03/22,"RUSSIA’S CATHEDRAL of the Armed Forces was consecrated in 2020. It sits in Patriot Park, a military theme park in Kubinka, around 60km to the west of Moscow. The church is khaki green, topped with a gold Orthodox cross. The diameter of the main dome, at 19.45m, references the end of the second world war. Nazi tanks were melted to make the floor. Angels gaze down on Russian soldiers in a mosaic commemorating the country’s role in Syria’s civil war, the invasion of Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014. In Russia, church and military go hand in hand. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, implicitly supports Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He spouts Kremlin propaganda, claiming that Russia is not the aggressor and that genocide is being perpetrated by Ukrainians against Russian speakers in the Donbas. Nor is his endorsement of this war unique. During his tenure, Russian priests have blessed bombs destined for Syria and Crimea. Bishop Stefan of Klin, who presides over the Cathedral of the Armed Forces, leads the church’s department for co-operation with the army. Before taking holy orders he was an officer in the missile-defence force. The Russian church was suppressed for decades under communism. Church property was seized by the state. Moscow’s Christ the Saviour Cathedral was blown up in 1931 to make way for a political convention centre (it was never completed). But the link between faith and national identity was not severed. In 2015, 71% of Russians identified as Orthodox and 57% said following the faith was an important part of what it meant to be Russian. Many perceive the church to be of growing importance in their lives, although few attend. This makes it a powerful tool of propaganda—a conduit through which to promote a single vision of Russian values, at odds with Western liberal societies. That is probably why Mr Putin has championed its resurgence. According to “First Person”, a collection of interviews with the Russian leader published in 2000, he wears a cross given to him by his mother when she had him secretly baptised as a baby. He has long chosen to present himself as a devout Orthodox Christian (charming George W. Bush, the American former president, with his piety) and promotes conservative religious values as a key tenet of nationalism. In 2007 he described nuclear armament and Orthodoxy as the two pillars of Russian society, guaranteeing external security and the moral health of the country respectively. But under Mr Putin’s leadership, the church might be better seen as a tool of internal security, promoting a vision of Russian identity compliant with the goals of his regime. It is perhaps no surprise that when Pussy Riot, a female punk band, protested against his premiership in 2012, they did so in a Moscow cathedral. Patriarch Kirill is a staunch ally of Mr Putin. In 2012, he described his presidency as a “miracle of God”. It has certainly benefited the church. On Mr Putin’s watch, Russia has passed laws that restrict the rights of rival religious groups, retrieved religious artefacts that were sold off under communism, and built thousands of churches. All that has bolstered the power that church leaders have to influence large swathes of the population. In 2007 the church reunited with many Russian parishes outside the country, healing a rift of 80 years. This boosted its power as a tool of foreign policy in the diaspora too. Church support for the invasion of Ukraine benefits the Kremlin in two important ways. First, the church emphasises the historic links between Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv, today the capital of Ukraine, was the seat of Orthodoxy when it arrived in tenth-century Kyivan Rus, a kingdom that at its height spanned modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia. Moscow oversaw the sole legitimate Orthodox church in Ukraine until 2019, when a new Ukrainian Orthodox Church was proclaimed. Patriarch Kirill has never accepted its autonomy. This month he described the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as coming “from one Kievan baptismal font” and claimed that they “share a common historical fate”. That argument helps to justify Russia’s spurious claims that it is liberating its neighbour. Second, Patriarch Kirill has long attacked the West for its perceived decadence, contrasting its “sinfulness” with conservative Russian values. He has painted the breakaway regions of Ukraine as victims of encroaching liberal influence, and seemed, bizarrely, to claim the war was happening in part because people in the Donbas do not want gay-pride parades to be imposed upon them. In a letter responding to the World Council of Churches, which had called on him to mediate for peace, he claimed his country was not the aggressor and that the “tragic conflict” had become part of a “geopolitical strategy aimed, first and foremost, at weakening Russia.” This untempered support of Kremlin propaganda has divided the church. More than 280 Russian Orthodox priests from around the world have signed an open letter condemning the invasion. Many of Moscow’s clerical supporters in Ukraine are now omitting Patriarch Kirill from their prayers. A parish in Amsterdam has resolved to quit the church; it intends to join the Istanbul-based Patriarchate of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s oldest see. The dissent is unlikely to sway church leaders in Moscow. The patriarch has begun to cast the conflict as a holy war, with implications that he says go beyond politics. “We have entered into a struggle that has not a physical, but a metaphysical significance,” he warned the faithful in his sermon on Forgiveness Sunday, the last day before Lent in the Orthodox calendar. The Armed Forces Cathedral’s mosaic commemorating the Russian wars that God has supposedly smiled upon leaves room for future conflicts. Ukraine may soon join the list.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThe West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
11,How the war split the mafia,,24/04/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warAleksandr otdelnov owns an unusual tourist attraction: a smuggling museum. Contraband has been flowing through his native Odessa since the 18th century. Until it closed because of covid-19, the museum displayed everything from pearls and pistols sneaked into imperial Russia to more contemporary loot. Then came the war in February 2022. “The port stopped working, and everything stopped,” says Mr Otdelnov. It wasn’t just the tourist flows that ended. Odessa had been a key node in a vast network of crime centred on Ukraine and Russia that reached from Afghanistan to the Andes. It was part of the “strongest criminal ecosystem in Europe”, reckons the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime (gitoc), a think-tank.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Russia’s invasion has hit this underworld with the force of an earthquake (see map 1). The vast majority of rock-hard Ukrainian mobsters have stopped collaborating with their Russian peers. “We are thieves, we are against any state, but we decided we are for Ukraine,” says one. Lucrative heroin-smuggling routes are being remapped, affecting prices and profits for criminal syndicates thousands of miles away. If the disruption proves lasting it could alter the face of global crime. It will also change Ukraine.The country has struggled with corruption ever since it left the Soviet Union in 1991. The Maidan revolution of 2013-14 overthrew a corrupt president and some of the oligarchy behind him. In 2019 Volodymyr Zelensky was elected as president on an anti-corruption platform and passed mafia-busting reforms. But at best it was a half-finished clean-up. Before the invasion gitoc ranked Ukraine 34th-worst out of 193 countries on its criminality index, and third in Europe. Ukraine also scored notably badly on perceptions of corruption.The underworld in the government-held parts of Ukraine before 2022 was intermittently, and violently, contested between different groups. Nonetheless it had three facets that linked Ukraine to global criminal markets. First, a contraband “superhighway” linking Russia and Ukraine, passing through the parts of eastern Ukraine that were occupied by Russia in 2014. Second, global smuggling hubs in Odessa and the other Black Sea ports. And finally factories in Ukraine for the production of illicit goods for export.This infrastructure supported different business models for different products. Ukraine was a growing “spin-off” transit route for heroin from Afghanistan, augmenting routes through the Balkans and the Caucasus (see map 2). Before the war it had the fourth-largest heroin seizures in Europe. Cocaine from Latin America flowed via the Black Sea. In the other direction, mobsters exported weapons to Asia and Africa, notably from Mykolaiv, a port. In 2020 Ukraine overtook China to become Europe’s largest source of illegal tobacco. The local manufacture of amphetamines was rising: 67 illegal laboratories were dismantled that year, the highest reported figure of any country.The war has changed everything by creating “an environment of unacceptable risk for international illicit trafficking”, says a new report from America’s government. Black Sea ports have been closed or much restricted for shipping. The boundary between government-run Ukraine and the territories occupied by Russia is now a fortified series of killing fields, breaking the superhighway. Enlistment in Ukraine has deprived the underworld of manpower while martial law has stopped a wide range of criminal activity. Curfews make it harder to move around at night.Ukrainian gangsters are also shunning their Russian counterparts. “It is one thing to be called a criminal; quite another to be thought of as a traitor,” says Mark Galeotti, author of “The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia”. Loyalty to Ukraine is about risk control as well as patriotism. “If we were annexed to Russia, many of the guys in prison might be transferred a long way away,” explains one gangster. “Russian guards are merciless. None of us need that. So we’ll do the dirty work for Ukraine.“The knock-on effects are being felt globally as contraband networks are reconfigured to bypass Ukraine. Turkish customs officials say more heroin and methamphetamines are flowing across the border with Iran. Lithuanian border officials saw a fourfold year-on-year rise in illicit tobacco volumes in the first quarter of 2022. Estonian officials working with Europol, the eu’s police agency, nabbed 3.5 tonnes of Latin American cocaine in the port of Muuga, worth roughly half a billion euros, last year. The blocking of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and increased controls in western Europe may also explain large seizures recently in Russia. On April 10th the authorities seized almost 700 kilos of cocaine in Moscow. Russian wiseguys close to the border with Belarus, once marginal, are now profiting from the smuggling of luxury goods into Russia, especially fancy designer handbags.The war has also meant new short-term opportunities for gangsters in Ukraine. One is people-smuggling. The un estimates that about 5m Ukrainian refugees are in “temporary protection” in Europe, and its statistical modelling of historical trends suggests perhaps 100,000 might become victims of people-trafficking. There is also a market for smuggling conscripts out of Ukraine. Sometimes this can be as simple as sneaking them past Ukrainian passport control. At least 8,000 have been caught trying to leave the country, mostly for Moldova or Poland. Smugglers reportedly charge from €5,000 ($5,500) to €10,000. Still, so far the scale of human-trafficking is not as bad as it could be. “It happens,” says a senior Europol official, “but far less than we expected.”The long-term impact of the war on criminality in Russia is likely to be malign. The state has intensified links with organised criminals that were already established, though only occasionally exploited, according to Mr Galeotti. Russian mobsters operating outside the country have been required to deposit a share of their profits in so-called “black accounts” that can be accessed by Russia’s spies to cover their operating costs. Criminals have been recruited to act as Kremlin intelligence agents, notably to help obtain much-needed embargoed semiconductors for the war effort. The seizure of Western-owned firms in Russia by the Kremlin or its proxies will fuel a new era of cronyism, while the requirement to mask cross-border transactions or bypass the Western financial system will reduce transparency and accountability further.For Ukraine the long-run picture is less clear cut. A frozen conflict could certainly create big risks. Before the invasion Ukraine had somewhere between 7m and 9m legal firearms. There were perhaps as many illicit ones. The country is now even more awash with weaponry. History suggests that wars fuel arms-dealing: guns from Yugoslavia are used in violent crime across Europe. Interpol’s secretary-general, Jürgen Stock, has warned there could be a surge in the trafficking of small arms. So far, however, so good. “We are not seeing arms-trafficking on a systematic or organised basis,” explains the Europol official.Domestic drug production could crank up again. America’s government recently reported the growth of more distributed networks of smaller drug laboratories in Ukraine which use the internet for sales and the postal system for delivery. The biggest risk comes from the process of reconstruction. Last month the World Bank put the cost of rebuilding Ukraine at $411bn, including $92bn on transport and $69bn on housing. Such large-scale projects could easily be preyed upon by mafias, who rig public-procurement systems and bidding systems to gain access to land, subsidies and licences.Still, there is an opportunity to make permanent the diminution in organised crime in Ukraine. The main effort must come from within the country. A draft law from December aims to reform urban planning: related government documents say the construction industry is prone to “abuse of power”, “general corruption” and “avoidance of punishment”. In January Mr Zelensky fired four deputy ministers and five regional governors for graft, according to Reuters. “Any internal problems that interfere with the state are being cleaned up,” he declared.Outside pressure may help: those reconstruction funds are likely to come largely from foreigners and to have strings attached. Ukraine’s eventual membership of the eu is still many years away but the process of converging with eu norms is a lever with which to combat organised crime. The country was given candidate status back in June.It is a truism among those who study organised crime around the world that war and social dislocation generate opportunities for gangsters and their white-collar collaborators. Yet there are unusual elements of Ukraine’s experience that might permit a different result. The war has severed the decades-old physical and social arteries between the country and Russia’s criminal networks, possibly for years to come. It has given the Ukrainian state further public legitimacy to combat oligarchy and may increase Western participation in, and scrutiny of, the economy. No one sensible thinks smuggling in Odessa will be relegated to a museum. But there is a chance that Ukraine could finally stop being a gangsters’ paradise.■This article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline ""The end of a gangsters’ paradise""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Sudan is not a one-off.

13,Giving Ukraine heavy weapons does not mean NATO is at war with Russia,,17/04/22,"A BILLION EUROS ($1.1bn) goes fast when you are fighting a war. But Germany’s announcement on April 15th that it would give around that sum in additional military aid to Ukraine may at least soften criticism of its failure to send tanks. It is part of a recent wave of pledges to provide Ukraine with heavy weapons. Two days earlier America promised $800m in new aid, including armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. Britain is sending armoured patrol vehicles and anti-ship missiles, while the Czech Republic has delivered mobile rocket-launchers and T-72 tanks from its old Soviet stockpiles. Slovakia, which has already sent Ukraine an S-300 anti-aircraft system, has said it might also provide MiG-29 fighter jets (pictured), a Soviet model that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly.In early March, America scotched a similar offer of MiG-29s from Poland, for fear it might invite reprisals from Russia, and thus drag NATO into the war. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, was more explicit still, suggesting that donations of heavy weapons might prompt Russia to label NATO a “co-belligerent”: a party to the conflict, and thus a legitimate target under the laws of war. Now, America says it has no objection to Slovakia’s offer. Early in the conflict Ukraine’s friends mainly stuck to giving it small arms and portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. As it has grown clear that the war will be a long one, they have become willing to supply it with complex systems that require months of training. Russian war crimes have also helped convince them to give Ukraine the heavier gear it needs to recapture occupied territory, and to help it shift from old Soviet kit to NATO-standard weaponry which could be maintained and armed more easily.Yet the shift to heavier weapons provokes anxiety in some quarters, especially in Germany, which has suspended an offer of Marder infantry fighting vehicles, after its defence ministry said it had too few to give any away. Sahra Wagenknecht, an MP from the Left party, said sending Marders would make Germany a Kriegsteilnehmer (“participant in the war”). Even Robert Habeck, the relatively hawkish climate minister, says Germany has “a responsibility not to become a target of attack ourselves”. All this seems to stem from a fear that delivering heavy weapons heightens the likelihood of a direct conflict between Russia and NATO.From a historical perspective such worries seem misplaced. Take the offer of MiG-29s. During the war in Vietnam, dozens of American planes were shot down by North Vietnamese fighter jets furnished by the Soviet Union. In addition to aircraft, North Vietnam received vast numbers of tanks, missiles and artillery pieces from its Soviet and Chinese patrons, and used them to kill thousands of American soldiers. Both sides worried that this proxy war could escalate into a direct conflict between nuclear powers. Yet it never did.The war in Ukraine presents a similar situation, with the roles reversed. This time it is Russia that is fighting a smaller state whose forces are being equipped and trained by America and its allies in NATO. Russia has warned NATO that it may strike countries that supply or aid Ukrainian forces, and has even hinted it might use nuclear weapons.From the perspective of international law, experts say, Russia’s position is unjustified. “Supplying weapons, including heavy weapons, would not in and of itself make a country a party to an armed conflict. That would require more direct involvement in military operations,” says Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers Law School and the author of “Law and Morality at War”.This has not always been the case. International law, as it developed in Europe beginning in the 17th century, required countries that wanted to stay out of others’ wars to observe strict neutrality. That meant they had to trade equally with both sides of a conflict, as Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro, professors at Yale Law School, explained in a recent article. Supplying arms to one side only, or favouring its trade, could make their ships fair game for attack by the other.But this law of neutrality was designed for a world where war was an accepted tool of statecraft. That changed with the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, which made it illegal to attack another country unprovoked—a principle later enshrined in the UN’s charter. The charter recognises that states have a right to self-defence, and that other countries can join in “collective self-defence” to help them. States are allowed to give military support to victims of aggression, or to impose sanctions on the aggressor, without affecting their own neutral status. Indeed, when the UN Security Council condemns an act of aggression, that resolution is legally binding on all member states.In Ukraine no such Security Council resolution has been adopted—but only because Russia, a permanent member, vetoed it. The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned the invasion. As for states becoming co-belligerents, the bar is even higher, argues Michael Schmitt of the United States Military Academy at West Point. German supplies of arms to Ukraine do not make Germany a party to the conflict with Russia because “there are no hostilities between the States concerned”—their soldiers are not killing each other.To many analysts, legal definitions of neutrality or co-belligerency seem irrelevant. If Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, decides not to target NATO convoys supplying arms to Ukraine, it will not be because of the persuasive force of international jurisprudence. Yet by the same token, it is naive to imagine that supplying only portable missiles (which, after all, still kill Russian troops) would lead Mr Putin to exercise restraint. “If Russia wants to feel provoked and attack NATO it will do it, independently of whether we have delivered tanks,” says Claudia Major of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.Others think that if supplying heavy weapons increases the risk of a direct conflict, it is mainly because they make more inviting targets. Portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles can be hidden and transported in commercial trucks. “To move tanks and artillery you have to put them on railway wagons, and that is more vulnerable to Russian air power, long-range artillery or cruise missiles,” says Dick Zandee, a defence expert at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. That could change the balance of risk and reward if Russia contemplates strikes that could kill NATO personnel, whether in Ukraine or on NATO territory. (In practice, Russia has shown little ability to track and strike moving targets even in eastern Ukraine.)Still, it is wrong to dismiss the legal aspects of co-belligerency entirely: they help prevent a conflict escalating to nuclear war. When America and other NATO countries rule out putting boots on the ground in Ukraine, they emphasise such a step would make them parties to the conflict. This, Mr Haque thinks, is a useful way to draw red lines between nuclear powers. “America is using these rules of international law to signal to Russia that we will come up to a clear red line but not cross it. I think Russia understands that signalling,” he says. “But they will try to contest the American interpretation of those rules and invent their own red lines—not based on law—to serve their aims.”This game of red lines took place in Vietnam too. The scale of Soviet and Chinese supplies of heavy weaponry to the North Vietnamese dwarfs anything imaginable in Ukraine. After the Sino-Soviet split in 1964, the two communist powers competed with each other in arms deliveries. By the end of the war, in 1975, they had sent North Vietnam upwards of 500 aircraft (including 180 fighters), 2,500 tanks and tens of thousands of artillery pieces. Soviet trainers often pressed the buttons on anti-aircraft missile systems that shot down American fighters over Hanoi. Russian historical propaganda websites still boast of this, even as Russia claims to be outraged by Western arms deliveries to Ukraine.Yet America never accused the Soviets or Chinese of being co-belligerents, and the nuclear powers never came close to direct conflict. American bombers avoided Soviet freighters: when US Air Force pilots accidentally strafed one in 1967, they were court-martialled. America was restrained not by international law but by the fact that bringing the Soviets or Chinese into the war would not have been in its interests.That will be the decisive factor for Russia in Ukraine, too. “If Russia wanted the conflict to spill over and drag us in, it would have already succeeded in doing that,” says Kalev Stoicescu of the International Centre for Defence and Security, a think-tank in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. “They want to frighten us but not get us directly engaged. They can barely manage Ukraine, let alone NATO.”Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThe West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
14,War in Ukraine will cripple global food markets,,12/03/22,"IN OCTOBER 1914 the Ottoman Empire, having just joined the first world war, blockaded the Dardanelles Strait, the only route for Russian wheat to travel to Britain and France. The world had entered the conflict with wheat stocks 12% above the five-year average, but losing over 20% of the global traded supply of the crop overnight set food markets ablaze. Having risen by a fifth since June 1914, wheat prices in Chicago, the international benchmark, leapt by another 45% over the following quarter.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Today Russia and Ukraine, respectively the largest and fifth-largest wheat exporters, together account for 29% of international annual sales. And after several poor harvests, frantic buying during the pandemic and supply-chain issues since, global stocks are 31% below the five-year average. But this time it is the threat of embargoes from the West that has lit a bonfire—and the flames are higher than even during the Great War. Wheat prices, which were already 49% above their 2017-21 average in mid-February, have risen by another 30% since the invasion of Ukraine started on February 24th. Uncertainty is sky-high: indicators of price volatility compiled by IFPRI, a think-tank, are flashing bright red.Rabobank, a Dutch lender, reckons wheat prices could climb by another third. But the damage to global food supply will extend far beyond the grain—and last longer than the war itself. Together Russia and Ukraine export 12% of the calories traded worldwide. They rank among the top five exporters of many oilseeds and cereals, from barley and corn to sunflowers, consumed by humans and animals. Russia alone is the biggest supplier of key ingredients in the making of fertilisers, without which crops falter or lose nutrients.In February, even before the war started, a food-price index compiled by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation had reached an all-time high; the number of people deemed food-insecure, at 800m, was at its highest for a decade. Many more could soon join them. Higher food prices will also stoke inflation, adding to the price pressures generated by dearer energy.The fallout from the war will be felt in three ways: disruption to current grain shipments, low or inaccessible future harvests in Ukraine and Russia, and withered production in other parts of the world. Start with shipments. In normal times wheat and barley crops are harvested in the summer and exported in the autumn; by February most ships are gone. But these are not normal times: with global stocks low, big importers of Black Sea wheat, chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa, are anxious to secure more supplies. They are not getting them. Ukrainian ports are shut. Some have been bombed. Inland routes, via the north of Ukraine and onwards through Poland, are too great a diversion to be practical. Vessels trying to pick up grain from Russia have been hit by missiles in the Black Sea. Most cannot get insurance.Alternative sources are unaffordable. Last week Egypt cancelled its second wheat tender in a row after receiving only three offers—at a stomach-churning price—down from 20 a fortnight before. More concerning still, exports of corn, of which Ukraine accounts for nearly 13% of global exports, usually take place through the spring until the early summer. Much of it is normally shipped from the port of Odessa, which is bracing for a Russian assault.Future crops are an even bigger worry. In Ukraine the war may result in lower yields and area planted. Winter crops such as wheat and barley, which are sown in October, could be smaller because of a lack of fertiliser and pesticides. Spring crops such as corn and sunflowers, the planting of which would normally start imminently, may not get sown at all. Leonid Tsentilo, whose farm in central Ukraine grows 7,000 tonnes of wheat a year, says local prices for diesel and plant-protection products have risen by 50% in two weeks. Some of his workers have been shipped off to war.In Russia the risk is not curtailed production but blockaded exports. Although food sales are not yet subject to sanctions, Western banks are reluctant to lend to traders. Fear of being fined by governments in the West or shamed by its press is keeping merchants at bay. While Ukraine is “unreachable”, Russia is “untouchable”, says Michael Magdovitz of Rabobank.Most alarming will be the conflict’s impact on agriculture worldwide. The region is a big supplier of critical fertiliser components, including natural gas and potash. Fertiliser prices had already doubled or tripled, depending on the type, even before the war, owing to rising energy and transport costs and sanctions imposed in 2021 on Belarus, which produces 18% of the world’s potash, as it cracked down on dissidents. As Russia, which accounts for 20% of global output, finds it harder to export its own potash, prices are sure to rise further. Since four-fifths of the world’s potash is traded internationally, the impact of price spikes will be felt in every agricultural region in the world, warns Humphrey Knight of CRU, a consultancy.As a result of all this, a much greater share of incomes will soon be spent on food (see chart). This will be felt most acutely in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia, where some 800m people depend heavily on Black Sea wheat. That includes Turkey, which supplies much of the southern Mediterranean with flour. Egypt usually buys 70% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. The latter alone accounts for half of Lebanon’s wheat imports. Many others can hardly do without Ukraine’s corn, soyabeans and vegetable oil.Meanwhile higher fertiliser and energy costs will crimp farmers’ margins everywhere. Brazil, a huge producer of meat and agricultural products, imports 46% of its potash from either Russia or Belarus, says Cristiano Veloso of Verde AgriTech, a Brazilian startup. Eventually some of the costs will be passed on to the consumer.Protectionism may pour more fuel on the fire. National restrictions on fertiliser exports increased last year and could accelerate. Limits on food exports, or panic-buying by importers, could trigger a price spike of the kind that sparked riots in dozens of countries in 2007-08. On March 8th and 9th, respectively, Russia and Ukraine banned wheat exports. Argentina, Hungary, Indonesia and Turkey have announced food-export restrictions in recent days.There is no easy fix. Some of the 160m tonnes of wheat used as animal feed every year could be diverted for human consumption, but substitution may export inflation to other staples. Increasing production in Europe and America and drawing on India’s vast strategic stockpile may yield 10-15m tonnes—a substantial quantity, but less than a third of Ukraine’s and Russia’s combined annual exports. Some could come from farther afield but there are bottlenecks: efforts to export more of Australia’s bumper winter-wheat crop have clogged the supply chains between its farms and ports. With corn, governments may resort to appropriating some of the 148m tonnes used as bioethanol feed to help plug this year’s likely shortfall of 35m tonnes. Fertiliser shortages are even harder to cover: new potash mines take 5-10 years to build.The war in Ukraine is already a tragedy. As it ravages the world’s breadbasket, a calamity looms. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Grainstorm""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Regulators arrange a deal for the California-based lenderThat is the popular narrative.

15,Ian Bremmer counts the cost of the war to Vladimir Putin,,23/04/22,"THE OUTCOME of Russia’s war in Ukraine remains in doubt. But there is no question that Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a large-scale invasion is one of the worst strategic decisions any leader of a powerful country has made in decades. There is no plausible outcome in Ukraine that won’t leave Mr Putin and Russia far worse off than before February 24th, when the war began.Mr Putin has cost his country the lives of thousands of young soldiers, some of them conscripts. He claims that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people,” but his war has given Ukraine a stronger sense of national identity than it’s ever had before and transformed it into Russia’s bitter enemy. He has shown the world that his army is ineffectual, and that billions of dollars spent on modernising Russia’s military has been wasted. He has given NATO a sense of unity and purpose it hasn’t had in decades and non-members like Finland and Sweden new reasons to join. His actions have driven members including Germany to boost defence spending. Others have dispatched troops close to Russia’s border. Mr Putin has convinced Europe that it must stop buying Russia’s most valuable exports. He has brought sanctions and export controls on his country that will inflict generational damage. For Europe and America he has crossed the Rubicon. Most grievously, he failed to prepare the Russian public for the true human, financial and material costs of his “special military operation.”Jokes about Russian vaccines and long tables aside, a primary cause of Mr Putin’s miscalculation must surely be his personal isolation. He appears no longer to listen to opposing points of view. How else could he have believed his army could capture Kyiv in two weeks? (The former president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, says Mr Putin bragged as much to him in 2014.) How could Mr Putin have thought that Ukrainians would quickly surrender once the invasion began? In response to Ukraine’s invasion, threats to cut off European energy supplies and other “consequences you have never seen”, Mr Putin appears to have expected the West to do little more than it did when Russia seized Crimea eight years ago. He did not anticipate that America would so quickly render a large portion of his foreign-exchange reserves functionally useless.By refusing to brook dissent inside Russia, Mr Putin has turned a deaf ear to important warnings and persuaded those around him that their personal security and prosperity depend on loyalty to him and his version of the truth. One small but important example: Mr Putin said during the early days of the conflict that “conscripted soldiers are not and will not be involved in combat operations.” That assertion was quickly proven false. There are three possible explanations for this, and all would damage Russia’s president. The first is that Mr Putin lied to the Russian people about something he should have known that he wouldn’t be able to hide. Second, Russia’s generals lied to him. Third and, frankly, most likely: misinformation has reached every level of Russia’s military, and senior officers are not aware of what’s happening down the chain of command. But whatever the case, all of these explanations undermine Mr Putin’s credibility, both at home and abroad, and compromise the effectiveness of Russia’s armed forces for years to come.There is no reason to believe that Russia’s failed “phase 1” effort to capture Kyiv will lead to significant improvements in the flow of information up and down the flow of military command. Incentive structures remain too warped. And if Russia’s armed forces aren’t producing accurate information about what’s happening in the field, or about the resources needed to achieve military objectives, and if Mr Putin and his generals continue to hold unrealistic ideas about what is achievable, the next phase of the war—focused on securing Russian control of the Donbas region—won’t proceed much more smoothly than the first phase. Ukraine’s soldiers in that region are battle-tested by eight years of combat. Underestimating the skill and determination of Ukrainians to fight, and the willingness of Western governments to supply them with weapons and training, has already cost Mr Putin dearly.For the Russian president, the stakes for military failure could hardly be higher. If his appeals to national pride and his pledges to end a (fictional) genocide of ethnic Russians in Donbas fall flat, the Russian president will probably take steps he would surely prefer to avoid. These might include the use of chemical weapons to turn the military tide as Ukrainians cannot defend against them, nor can they return attacks in kind (which will allow Russia to advance). He doesn’t have much more to lose. Russia already faces a transatlantic political and military alliance that has imposed historically harsh sanctions on his country. Western governments continue to support Ukraine, to accuse Russia of war crimes and genocide, and to treat Mr Putin like a pariah. A scorched-earth approach would probably win him a limited military victory. And he knows that almost everything the West could do to him is already in process—short of a ban on Russian energy imports that Mr Putin surely believes is coming soon anyway.Western hopes that Russia’s generals, its security forces, its oligarchs or its people will soon remove Mr Putin from power are likely to be in vain. Sky-high oil prices will keep the Russian economy afloat for some time, even as the long-term damage to Russia’s economy done by sanctions and export controls will be severe. Given the political climate, it’s impossible to know the true state of Russian public opinion, but there is no evidence that Mr Putin faces any serious domestic challenge. Russia’s people see the images of war their government wants them to see, and they are now being fed a steady diet of Ukrainian atrocities, Western plans to humiliate Russia and the determination of their president and soldiers to defend their motherland.In short, Mr Putin, Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, and Western leaders should not expect the kind of clean victory that any of them desires. Instead, an ugly war is about to get much uglier._______________Ian Bremmer is the founder and president of Eurasia Group.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the By Invitation section of the print edition under the headline ""Ian Bremmer counts the cost of the war to Vladimir Putin""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The banking system would be stronger without it, argues the investment bankerStorytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopherLike Zionism itself, the state has become a settler-colonial movement, argues the academic and author"
16,The head of GCHQ says Vladimir Putin is losing the information war in Ukraine,,18/08/22,"IT IS A fallacy to say that cyber has not been a factor in the war in Ukraine. Both sides are using cyber capabilities to pursue their aims. Both sides understand the potential of integrating cyber and information confrontation with their military effort. And both sides know that they are engaged in a struggle for influence and opinion far beyond the immediate battlefield. It is a very modern digital and cyber war, as much as it is a brutal and destructive physical one. Six months after Russia’s invasion, it is becoming clear how differing physical and virtual approaches have shaped the conflict. Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The country’s use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.Their information operations have proven clumsy and have been challenged by the release of intelligence. And Russian military attempts to destroy the digital infrastructure of Ukraine and to sow discord using cyber capabilities have been met with staunch, professional and effective Ukrainian cyber defence. As the UK’s intelligence, cyber and security agency, GCHQ has long tracked the threat that Russia poses. With our allies we have an ever-evolving picture of its intelligence and military objectives in cyberspace. We have consistently called out their activities that go beyond responsible behaviour in cyberspace. We have challenged the ways in which the Russian state has turned a blind eye to the powerful criminal cyber groups operating with impunity in the country. And we have worked with industry and our allies, to operate in support of Ukraine, address disinformation and safeguard critical cyber infrastructure. Although we knew that Russia was capable of playing by different rules, its actions in Ukraine have now shown this to the world. As a result, we are seeing a reshaping of the cyber landscape. There is now much greater co-operation between big tech companies and governments on security than before the war, a polarisation of positions on the use of cyber in war and a renewed effort to redefine cyber norms.Looking back, we now know that the first shots of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine were taken in cyberspace before bullets were fired on February 24th. The month before, Russian Military Intelligence deployed WhisperGate malware to destroy and deface Ukrainian government systems. And less than an hour before Russia invaded Ukraine, it targeted ViaSat satellite networks used by Ukrainian military, government and civilians. The attack spilled over into neighbouring countries causing collateral damage across a range of services, from wind farms to internet access. Secret intelligence allowed us to spot this activity. The private sector spotted it too, and companies were quick to publicise and patch the problem. This partnership, between government and the private sector, which the National Cyber Security Centre (a part of GCHQ) plays a leading role in, has become increasingly important as Russian efforts to disrupt Ukrainian government and military systems have intensified. Online disinformation quickly became a major part of Russia’s campaign, to cause confusion and chaos in Ukraine and beyond. Russia has used this playbook before, including in Syria and the Balkans. It aims to sow mistrust in information sources, to misrepresent Ukrainian actions and to promulgate false narratives about the reasons for Russia’s actions. We have taken action to counter these twisted truths. From providing warnings about the onset of war, to the rapid release of intelligence, and working with Western technology platforms to remove lies, we have shone a spotlight on the Russian state’s approach. Much of this has been successful. So far, President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West. Although that is cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world. Many of the most populous countries did not agree to the UN motion censuring Russia for its invasion. Public opinion in those places matters and it is influenced already by the information coming out of Russia. This is a new front to the war in Ukraine and its effects will endure at least as long as the conflict does. We must take action to confront organised state disinformation campaigns and to ensure they do not succeed in blunting international outrage over Russia’s actions.In all of these areas, we have seen the Russian state try to align and co-ordinate cyber capabilities alongside more traditional facets of military power. To date, this hybrid intent has not succeeded; the impact has been less than we (and they) expected. In part, this is because Ukraine has proved itself to be an extremely effective cyber defender. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, it has painstakingly developed a digital fortress. As we have witnessed heroic defence by Ukraine’s military, online we have arguably seen the most effective defensive cyber activity in history. Operating under sustained pressure against a very capable adversary, this team of industry, intelligence, security agencies and in some cases, citizens, has worked side by side to warn, respond and remediate. These cyber defences proved stronger than Russia anticipated. Somewhat ironically, we’ve seen its military activity compound its problems. Russian strikes took down the very networks they were trying to infect. They forced the Ukrainians to diversify and use alternative forms of communication that were more secure. That actually enhanced Ukrainian resilience. Thankfully, all of this cyber activity has not resulted in collateral damage outside Ukraine of the scale of the NotPetya attacks in 2017, which disrupted Ukraine’s banks, airports and more. This may be because Russian cyber actors are carefully calibrating to avoid escalation. Afterall, NATO has made it clear that a serious cyber-attack against a member country could trigger Article 5, the alliance’s mutual defence clause. The danger of overspill to NATO countries is very real—we’ve seen incompetence and carelessness by Russia before. An important component of our response to this situation may involve the UK’s National Cyber Force (NCF)—a partnership between GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence. This builds out from our world class cyber defence and resilience, to deliver offensive cyber capabilities. I won’t go into detail about NCF activity—stealth and ambiguity are key attributes of cyber operations. This secret and important work is conducted in accordance with international law and domestic legislation. It is authorised by ministers and scrutinised by judicial commissioners. It is this ethical, proportionate and legal approach that sets us apart from our adversaries and from Russia’s use of cyber capabilities in this war. Learning the lessons of these early stages of President Putin’s war, it is hard to overstate the importance of Ukrainian cyber defence to the fight. The country’s experience has shown that online, the defender gets to choose how vulnerable they are to attack. And that we, as allies, show we are serious about the responsible use of cyber power. These are lessons that we and like-minded partners around the world must heed. ■Sir Jeremy Fleming is the Director of GCHQ, the UK’s Intelligence, Cyber and Security Agency.This article appeared in the By Invitation section of the print edition under the headline ""The head of GCHQ says Vladimir Putin is losing the information war in Ukraine""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The banking system would be stronger without it, argues the investment bankerStorytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopherLike Zionism itself, the state has become a settler-colonial movement, argues the academic and author"

19,The war is making Ukraine a Western country,,21/02/23,"Editor’s note: This is one of a series of daily articles we will be publishing in the run-up to the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th. See the rest of our coverage and the photo essay including the above picture.Ukraine’s armed forces had prepared for the invasion that began at 4:30am on February 24th, but many ordinary Ukrainians had not. Svitlana Povalyaeva, a writer, had to be woken by her 24-year-old son, Roman Ratushny, at about 5am. She wanted to go back to sleep; he insisted that she take the news seriously. “They’re bombing Boryspil airport with fucking ballistic missiles,” he railed.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Prepared or not, people like Mr Ratushny jumped into action. Later that day he returned to see his mother, in military fatigues, with a gun. She screamed at him hysterically, desperate to stop him going off to war and getting himself killed. But she also knew that he was a determined sort, who had faced down death-threats while campaigning to stop a wood in Kyiv being bulldozed by developers. As she feared, her protests were in vain.Mr Ratushny was not the only one doing the unexpected that day. When Andrii, a fighter pilot, finally took a break after almost 19 hours of sorties, too exhausted to fly any more, his commanding officer spooned stew into his mouth to revive him. Vitaly Shabunin ignored warnings that his name was on a list of people whom Russian soldiers had been instructed to kill, and set about turning his anti-corruption organisation into a network to support the armed forces. Famously, Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, declined to flee the onslaught. Instead, the next day, he posted a video of himself in the centre of Kyiv to reassure Ukrainians that the state was still functioning. “We’re all here,” he declared. “The military is here. Citizens and society are here. We’re defending our independence, our country.”With Mr Zelensky setting the bar for courage, the Ukrainian state proved much less flimsy than the Russians—and many Westerners—had expected. What is more, many ordinary Ukrainians were eager to come to its defence. During the course of the war, the state and civic pride have become stronger still. “We had belief in the resilience of our institutions, but it was only after 24th February that we became sure,” says Denys Shmyhal, the prime minister. “We paid bills, collected taxes, supported business, provided services and restructured the economy. Our Western partners tell us they are amazed at how strong we’ve been.”The Russians, says Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, “don’t get what Ukraine is about”. They disliked that it was becoming a more functional democracy and, by fits and starts, drawing closer to Europe. But they did not understand how far that process had advanced. On the face of things, after all, the country was still riven by political divisions, addled by corruption and dominated by powerful oligarchs. Twice in a decade, in 2004 and 2014, protesters had toppled unpopular governments. The previous president, Petro Poroshenko, a media and chocolate magnate, had been voted out in part because of a litany of corruption scandals. Russian-speakers in the south and east of the country seemed alienated, often voting differently from the rest of the country. And in 2014 Ukraine had not been able to stop Russia seizing Crimea and fomenting rebellion in the Donbas region. But all the upheaval, while revealing discontent and division, also showed that civil society was becoming more vigorous and politics more responsive to it. People like Mr Shabunin and Mr Ratushny, who both participated in the Maidan protests in 2013-14, kept up their activism after the crowds had dispersed, the first as an anti-corruption campaigner, the second as an environmentalist. Despite the domination of the media by oligarchs, a free press had also sprung up, abetted by the internet. Large-scale migration for work to European countries, and a liberal regime for tourism, had helped develop an affinity for Europe. Meanwhile, efforts to curb corruption had begun to undermine Russia’s chief means of exerting influence. The war has accelerated all these trends. Almost overnight Ukraine’s geographical divisions, which had anyway diminished since 2014, disappeared. Russian-speakers bore the brunt of the invasion, since they are concentrated close to the Russian border. The indiscriminate, vicious offensive disabused them of any illusions they might have had about Russia’s brotherly benevolence. According to Volodymyr Paniotto, a pollster, most of the 9m or so Russian-speakers in Ukraine now regard it as their homeland. Many of them are learning Ukrainian and immersing themselves in Ukrainian culture, which they might previously have seen as quaint or parochial.The political rift about whether Ukraine’s future lies more with Russia or the West has also been decisively resolved. Ukraine has officially become a candidate for eu membership, a step that was seen as a decade away before the invasion. A full 86% of Ukrainians want their country to join Nato, up from barely half before the war.Fewer Ukrainians describe themselves as cynical than a year ago; three and a half times as many (68%) express optimism for the future. Trust in government and institutions has increased. Mr Zelensky’s approval rating shot up after the invasion, from barely 30% to over 90%. Mykola Davydiuk, a political analyst, likens the surprisingly concerted response to the invasion to the behaviour of bees: “In normal times, bees buzz around and make honey. But when a bear tries to steal it, they swarm, and sting him.” Ukrainians’ willingness to swarm, in turn, reflects genuine improvements in its institutions, and above all in the armed forces. When Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Viktor Muzhenko, Ukraine’s top general at the time, said his army was “literally in ruins” and suffering from “total demoralisation”. Much of the navy defected to Russia rather than fight. Mr Poroshenko initiated sweeping military reforms. America, Britain and Canada sent aid and advisers. Five battalions a year received training from America at a military base in western Ukraine. America first gave Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles—used to great effect to repel the Russian advance on Kyiv—in 2017. Perhaps most importantly, Ukraine’s military culture was transformed. By the time Russia invaded again last year, says Liam Collins, a former US Army officer involved in those efforts, “Ukraine had built a well-led, professional force with a culture that encouraged junior leader initiative on the battlefield.” Other parts of the government, too, have shown remarkable adaptiveness. Ukrzaliznytsya, the state railway company, runs trains through war zones, evacuating citizens and ferrying troops, supplies, and diplomats in the opposite direction. Government cyber-security agencies draw on the best IT specialists in the country to provide a robust defence against some of the world’s most sophisticated hackers. Engineers in the power industry work around the clock, sometimes in body armour, to somehow bandage together infrastructure as fast as Russia bombs it.The Ukrainian state still has many weaknesses. Corruption continues to plague it. A recent scandal involving overpriced contracts for military rations shows that plenty of venal officials remain, even in the Ministry of Defence. Nor has petty politics disappeared: the president’s office is paranoid about the stratospheric popularity of Valery Zaluzhny, the head of the armed forces, and appears to be circumscribing his role. “Ukraine faces its biggest danger when politicians start interfering and telling soldiers what to do,” warns Mr Shabunin.And whatever strides Ukraine has made, they must be weighed against the catastrophic consequences of the war. Hundreds of thousands have died. Whole cities have been razed. Ms Povalyaeva, the mother of Mr Ratushny, who headed to the front so eagerly on the first day of the war, says she sensed that her son would die many months before he eventually did, on a reconnaissance mission in June. She could see the desperation on his face. “The pain is unbearable,” she says, reflecting on her son’s squandered potential. “We are losing our best people. The very people we need if we are to build the modern, just society we all now demand.” ■Photograph: ron haviv/viiRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""Battle-tested""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Its defences against Western sanctions can only stretch so farBut the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understood"
20,Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused at least $68bn in physical damage,,05/04/22,"Footage from the Ukrainian front line shows buildings reduced to rubble, black smoke and twisted metal. Assessing such destruction in the fog of war is a tall order. But according to an early analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), the physical damage already exceeded $68bn as of April 1st, equivalent to more than a third of Ukraine’s GDP in 2021.The team of analysts combined around 1,000 eyewitness reports with data on damaged structures from Ukrainian government ministries. Cities besieged or captured by the Russian army—like Chernihiv and Mariupol—are still unreachable. To estimate the damage in these areas the researchers relied on rough estimates from town officials.There has been at least $28bn worth of damage to roads. Add in damage to bridges, ports and railways, and the infrastructure bill exceeds $32bn. Some 196 health-care facilities have been destroyed across Ukraine, which will cost another $2bn to rebuild. Around 300 kindergartens lay in ruins, amounting to $226m worth of damage. These numbers are incomplete: economic losses, destruction of livestock and crops, and a shrinking workforce as people flee are not included. Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy and KSE estimate that all losses combined could range from $564bn to $600bn, or 2.8 to 3 times its GDP in 2021. For comparison, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia reckons that in the first eight years of war in Syria, the country suffered economic and physical losses of $440bn, or 1.5 times its pre-war GDP. As the war in Ukraine goes on, the reconstruction bill will only rise. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

21,Russia says it is changing its war aims in Ukraine,,28/03/22,"Editor’s note: On March 29th Russia said it would “drastically reduce combat operations” around Kyiv and Chernihiv, another northern city in Ukraine. This article has been updated as a result.ON FEBRUARY 26TH, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, RIA Novosti, a Russian state-run news agency, accidentally published an article that had been due to run two days into what the Kremlin thought would be a quick and easy war. “Ukraine has returned to Russia,” it boasted. “Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev?” A month into its botched campaign, Russia may be doing just that. On March 25th Russia’s defence ministry held a briefing in which three generals—including General Mikhail Mizintsev, compared by Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence minister, to a “Death Eater” from the Harry Potter books—declared that the war was a roaring success. “The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,” they declared, despite much evidence to the contrary. Kyiv was never the aim, they insisted. It was attacked only to prevent Ukraine from reinforcing the Donbas region in the east (see map). Russia first invaded Donbas in 2014, creating two so-called “People’s Republics” which it recognised as independent states on February 21st this year. “Our main aim,” said the generals, is “liberating Donbas.” On March 29th, when Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Turkey, Russia’s deputy defence minister said that its forces would “drastically reduce” operations around Kyiv and Chernihiv, another northern city.The idea that Russia was only ever interested in Donbas is nonsense. Western officials who had sight of Russian war plans for months before the invasion say that the intention was to capture Kyiv and occupy much of the country. As he launched the war, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, promised: “We will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine.” His forces’ actions in the first days of the war, including a cack-handed effort to seize Hostomel airport outside Kyiv, attest to this (the airport has been in and out of Russian hands since). Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has claimed that his forces found ceremonial uniforms in the first batch of captured Russian tanks, suggesting that the Kremlin was planning a victory parade. Russia is pivoting largely because the first phase of its war has been a failure. Its pincer movement on the capital from the north-west and north-east has stalled in the face of staunch Ukrainian resistance, jammed-up supply lines and a shortage of manpower. Russia has failed to encircle the capital, let alone assault it. Nor has it taken any major city other than Kherson—and even there its control looks increasingly precarious. One NATO official says that the alliance estimates that somewhere between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops may have died so far—a rate that would outstrip any Russian military operation since the bloodiest campaigns of the second world war—with as many as 40,000 casualties (those killed, captured, wounded or missing) overall.Some officials think the Russian announcement of a new phase in the war could be a ruse, intended to draw Ukrainian defenders away from the capital. “I don’t think Putin has said goodbye to the idea of regime change in Kyiv yet,” warns Sabine Fischer of the SWP think-tank in Berlin. Explosions could be heard around Kyiv on March 27th. Early on March 28th British defence intelligence said that there had been “no significant” change to the disposition of Russian forces in occupied areas in the preceding 24 hours. A Western official notes that Russia “still poses a significant threat to Kyiv through their strike capability”. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that Russian strategy is changing on the ground.Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, which tracks the war, says that “the most battered units” are being withdrawn and sent back to Russia to recuperate. Satellite pictures show no Russian troops at Hostomel airport, for instance. Russian forces outside Kyiv are “digging in” and “establishing defensive positions”, noted a US defence official on March 25th, suggesting that efforts to enter the capital have been put on ice. On March 28th Ukraine’s armed forces claimed that Russia was blowing up several bridges, including one on the Snov river north-east of Chernihiv. At the same time, Russia has prioritised its offensives in the Donbas, and fighting there has intensified over the past week. The Western official says that forces from Georgia and Kaliningrad, as well as fighters from the Wagner Group, a network of mercenary companies, are being deployed to the area. Russian forces have attempted to move south from Izyum, a town 125km south-east of Kharkiv, at the same time as they advance north towards Zaporizhia, with the intention of encircling what the Ukrainians call the Joint Forces Operation (JFO)—the troops fighting around Donbas—and preventing them from retreating west over the Dnieper river. There is no guarantee that Russia can achieve this: its supply lines would be stretched further, and progress south from Kharkiv and Izyum has been slow and grinding. Ukrainian forces are still mounting counter-attacks around Kharkiv and Izyum, among other places. The furthest extent of Russia’s northward advance is currently Huliaipole, which leaves some way to go. But if the manoeuvre works, it would be a blow to Mr Zelensky. “A lot depends on whether or not Mariupol falls,” says Ben Barry of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank. The city appears surrounded and will eventually run out of ammunition and supplies; that could free up Russian forces to move north.Russia might see victory in Donbas as a consolation prize for its failure to secure regime change in Kyiv—and perhaps as an exit strategy. Russian proxies held only a third of Donbas before this war; the rest of the region includes Mariupol, the besieged port, the loss of which would deprive Ukraine of any coastline on the Sea of Azov. Since Mariupol is home to the Azov battalion, a paramilitary group in Ukraine’s armed forces which boasts SS insignia, conquering it would also serve the Kremlin’s narrative that it is “de-Nazifying” the country. Russia may also still hope to keep a so-called land bridge to Crimea, which would run through Mariupol and stretch farther west beyond Donbas.What Russia intends to do with all this territory is less clear. One option would be to use it as a bargaining chip to secure other concessions from Mr Zelensky, such as limits on Ukraine’s foreign policy and armed forces. But because Russia has already recognised the independence of the sham republics—“Ukraine does not need these territories,” declared Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now the deputy chairman of its security council, on February 21st—this could be tricky.Another option would be to annex it to Russia, though the Kremlin probably lacks the appetite to govern and rebuild these areas. A third would be to create another frozen conflict like those in Transnistria, in Moldova, and South Ossetia and Abkhazia, in Georgia, places where Russia has garrisoned its troops for years, essentially creating proxy pseudo-states to wield influence over those countries. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, says that Russia’s aim is to “create North and South Korea in Ukraine”.Whatever the endgame, a military strategy that focuses on Donbas is a losing proposition. Grabbing chunks of Ukraine (or Georgia before that, and Moldova before that) and using them as leverage could be done at a tolerable economic and military price to Russia in 2014. Doing so now is a different matter. In an interview with The Economist in Kyiv on March 25th, Mr Zelensky suggested he was open to territorial compromises: “Our land is important, yes, but ultimately it’s just territory.” Two days later he told Russian journalists: “I understand it’s not possible to make Russia completely leave the [Donbas] territory—that’ll lead to world war three.” But even Mr Zelensky, wildly popular as he is, would probably be unable to persuade his compatriots to relinquish land beyond that which was lost in the Russian attacks of 2014-15. Russian occupation of the greater Donbas would thus come at a heavy cost. Ukraine’s armed forces, flush with confidence and Western weaponry, are likely to expand their counter-attacks; some even harbour hopes of driving Russia out entirely. Western countries—buoyed by Ukraine’s resilience, surprised by their own solidarity and wary of setting a precedent for other aggressors—are unlikely to lift sanctions as long as Russia hangs on to any of its new gains from this war. Those sanctions are suffocating Russia; S&P, a ratings agency, forecasts that its GDP will shrink by 22% this year, setting it back by 15 years.The irony is that, had Mr Putin confined his war to the Donbas from the beginning, he might have split the West and avoided such punitive measures. Now the Kremlin faces an unappetising choice. It can have Mariupol—or it can have an economy.

22,How heavy are Russian casualties in Ukraine?,,24/07/22,"The average war since 1816 has seen around 50 battlefield deaths a day. Russia’s war in Ukraine is much bloodier. In recent days Bill Burns, the director of the cia, Richard Moore, the chief of mI6, and Mikk Marran, the head of Estonia’s foreign intelligence service, have all said that around 15,000 Russians have died since February 24th—an average rate of more than 100 per day. Ukrainian officials say that, recently, their own casualty rate has been similar, and at times much worse. “My expectation is that the war will exceed the deadliness of other large non-world war European wars, like the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War,” says Paul Poast of the University of Chicago. But how are casualty figures estimated?Military casualties are divided into two main categories: killed in action (kia) and wounded in action (wia), some of whom die later. Those who are captured and taken as prisoners-of-war and those who go missing are counted separately. Some estimates of Russian casualties in Ukraine cover only army personnel. Others include forces from the Rosgvardiya (national guard), fsb (the main successor to the kgb) and other non-army regulars, like the vdv airborne forces that were decimated in the first phase of the conflict. And some take in fighters from Russian-backed militias in the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics—a pair of puppet governments in eastern Ukraine—which have conscripted large numbers of local residents. These, alongside Russian mercenaries, have done much of the hard fighting in recent months.American officials reckon that between 15,000 and 20,000 Russians, across all three of these categories, have died in total since the war began on February 24th, according to one informed source. On June 29th Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence minister, said that 25,000 Russians had been killed. In truth, Mr Burns was citing the lower bound of America’s estimate; Mr Wallace the upper end of his. Ukraine’s own tally is 38,500 as of July 19th, though the country has an obvious incentive to proffer the highest possible figure. On July 19th Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, claimed, somewhat implausibly, that 11,000 Russians had died in the battles for Severodonetsk and Lysychansk alone.This spread of figures reflects the fact that estimating another country’s casualties inevitably involves guesswork. “It is not a precise science,” says one Western official. The details of casualty estimation tend to be classified, but analysts have several means at their disposal. One is to piggyback on Russian estimates by using secret intelligence, such as agents inside the Russian government or intercepted communications in which Russian units describe their casualties. Yet these can be distorted: Western officials think Mr Putin himself is not being given the full picture of how badly his war is going. Another is to go by Ukrainian “contact reports” of the same battles, though that becomes harder when much of the fighting is done beyond visual range by artillery, rather than in close-up infantry combat. The third is to infer casualties from destroyed equipment, which can be observed on everything from social media to satellite imagery, drawing on prior knowledge of how many Russians tend to man a particular vehicle (the Russian tank pictured above will have had three crew members, for instance) or make up a certain sort of unit. However these calculations are made, what is clear is that their “error bars” are wide, reflecting considerable uncertainty.Getting at figures for those wounded is even harder. It is also vital, since an army’s effectiveness depends not on how many of its soldiers die but on how many are out of action. Some of that can be done by observing field hospitals, blood stockpiles and other indicators of medical activity. Usually, though, analysts have to make inferences on the assumption that soldiers tend to be wounded in a somewhat predictable ratio to the number killed.But which ratio to pick? In the first and second world wars, the average ratio for America’s army was just over three to one—that is, three wounded for every one killed—according to figures compiled by the Dupuy Institute, which collects historical data on war. However, that changed over the 20th century. Research by Tanisha Fazal of the University of Minnesota shows that the wounded-to-killed ratio has soared in the post-war period (see chart) because soldiers go into war much healthier, have better protective equipment once they get there, are evacuated faster if they are injured and enjoy better medical care overall.A war that killed 1,200 soldiers in 1860 would be expected to produce just 800 fatalities by 1980, she notes—but many of those who would earlier have died will show up as wounded. Consequently in the Iraq war, between 2003 and 2011, the ratio for America’s lavishly resourced army was almost nine to one; in Afghanistan almost ten to one. These ratios, the highest ever achieved in a big modern war, were in part the result of getting critical care to wounded soldiers within 60 minutes of an injury, a period known as the “golden hour”, by deploying more surgical teams and speeding up medical evacuation, or medevac. The question is how much of this applies to Russia. In Iraq and Afghanistan, America made intensive use of helicopters for medevac. That is harder when helicopters get shot down a lot—as they do in Ukraine. America would arguably face the same problem in comparable circumstances. Dr Fazal, writing with military doctors in War on the Rocks, an online journal, in 2018, noted that simulations showed that treatment within the golden hour would be far harder for America in a scrap with a peer or near-peer adversary. A war against North Korea, for instance, would require evacuating casualties equivalent in number to those suffered by America in all its conflicts in the previous 17 years (including Iraq and Afghanistan) “in a period of months, if not weeks”. That would swamp even America’s medevac capabilities. And Russia’s are rustier. Its military medicine is “less developed” than its Western equivalent, says Ronald Ti, an expert on military medical logistics at King’s College London (kcl), with particular weaknesses in battlefield trauma medicine delivered by paramedics. The emphasis—as in many former Soviet republics, including Ukraine—is on sending casualties back to doctors in hospitals in rear areas. “This is all well and good,” says Dr Ti, “but the result is that casualties turn into deaths because of the longer evacuation lines.” That is evident from Western figures. Mr Burns and Mr Marran said that Russia had suffered three times as many wounded as killed. That is roughly in line with documents captured by Ukraine, and analysed by Rob Lee of kcl and Michael Kofman of cna, a think-tank. The documents showed losses in the 1st Tank Army, a key Russian offensive formation, until mid-March. They suggested a 3.4:1 ratio, rising to 4:1 if missing soldiers were counted as dead. The latter is very close to the ratio reported by the Donetsk people’s republic militia, who, unlike the Russian army, have faithfully documented their casualties. A further wrinkle, says Mr Kofman, is that the ratio can fall as wounded soldiers die but rise as artillery—a weapon that wounds through shrapnel—dominates the battlefield, as it has in recent months. These calculations might seem arcane. But the specific ratio one chooses has important implications for judging just how badly the Russian army has been mauled, a key metric in a protracted war of attrition. The choice of a 3:1 ratio by American and Estonian intelligence suggests that 60,000 Russian fighters have been taken off the battlefield, though some soldiers wounded in February or March will have recovered by now.If instead Mr Wallace’s death toll is correct, it implies 100,000 have been put on the sidelines at one time or another. That rises to a whopping 125,000—equivalent to the entire ground combat force with which Russia started the war—if Ukraine’s new Western artillery has inflated the ratio to 4:1. This multiplier effect means that very high estimates of Russian deaths are less plausible, argues Mr Kofman. If overall casualties were dramatically higher than the American and British figures, the Russian army would visibly have been in even deeper trouble long ago. Nevertheless, Russian losses on this scale do explain why so many Russian battalions are grossly understrength, why their advance in Donbas has been grindingly slow and why the army is now scraping together reserve battalions from volunteers across the country. If Ukraine mounts a large-scale counter-offensive in the southern Kherson province in the coming months, that will stretch Russian forces thinner still. And the officers who lead the army have been especially badly hit: “thousands” of lieutenants and captains and “hundreds” of colonels have been killed, observed an American official on July 22nd. Unsurprisingly, the number of troops refusing to fight now runs into the thousands, says another source.Perhaps the saving grace for Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is that there has so far been no serious backlash at home to such profligacy. “These are not middle-class kids from St. Petersburg or Moscow,” noted mI6’s Mr Moore. “These are poor kids from rural parts of Russia. They’re from blue-collar towns in Siberia. They are disproportionately from ethnic minorities. These are his cannon fodder.”■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"

24,"There will be African victims of Russia’s war, warn Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Olusegun Obasanjo",,19/06/22,"THE CONTINUATION of the war in Ukraine is of great concern to Africa. It is time that Africans spoke out in our continent’s interests. Even before the war, Africa faced a perfect storm. It suffered from isolation from global supply chains during covid-19, stalling the economic recovery that was beginning to take shape. A debt crisis looms, with 25 African countries in debt distress or at high risk of defaulting, with Zambia and Nigeria among the worst affected. This is all happening against the backdrop of a rapid demographic change. The continent’s population will double to 2.5bn over the next generation, and most of this new cohort will live in cities. Although the shift will bring advantages, it will also place greater pressure on food supplies and on infrastructure.Now the spectre of inflation, too, hangs over Africa. It has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which will affect the cost of food in particular. Many countries across north Africa and regional powers such as Ethiopia and Kenya depend on imports from Ukraine or Russia. According to the African Development Bank, wheat prices have risen by no less than 60% in recent months. To compound the shortages, there is likely to be a 2m-tonne deficit in fertilisers for African fields, resulting in a 20% smaller harvest.Unlike covid-19, this unfolding catastrophe is a choice. Whether we like it or not, that choice is primarily in the hands of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, who has the power to stop the war and to allow the resumption of wheat exports from the conflict zone.Although most African countries have called on Russia to stop the invasion through a UN resolution, many others have chosen the path of silence or neutrality. This, too, is not the right path. But criticism of the decision to invade Ukraine will not, on its own, produce the conditions for a peaceful outcome. What is needed is an acceptable off-ramp for both sides that silences the guns and leads to a return to respect for sovereignty, dialogue and a political solution. We need a strong drive for peace, security, co-operation and stability in Russia-Ukraine relations. To achieve this requires three components: strong external pressure on warring parties to talk and to keep talking until there is a resolution; an internal willingness among all parties to prefer peace to war; and, possibly most important, strong leadership willing to bring the peace process to a conclusion and to accept necessary compromises.Yet the absence of a united stance among African countries has allowed a sophisticated game of diplomatic charades. Most recently, the chair of the African Union, Senegal’s President Macky Sall, met Mr Putin. Mr Sall said that sanctions against Russia were the reason why grain stocks and fertiliser were not being exported from Ukraine and Russia.At that very moment, however, Ukrainian wheat stores and supplies were being destroyed and stolen by Russian soldiers. Ukraine used to supply half of the world’s exports of sunflower oil. When a two-storey silo containing sunflower meal is destroyed, the cost to Africa is immediate and immense.We need to act to end this war. Russia, which launched the conflict, has to accept the primary responsibility for initiating action to stop it. And Ukraine must be ready to respond positively. But a permanent solution is wider than the current protagonists alone. It must encompass a reset in our global security architecture.Its dysfunction can no better be illustrated than by the participation of one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council members in the war. This neuters the UN’s response. The institution is no longer fit for purpose. It is time for a re-ordering of international relations.The UN Security Council is an artefact of the cold war. It needs overhauling so it becomes more representative. Africans must have a voice and cease to be passive spectators as global events pummel our continent.UN agencies need more resources so as to minimise disruption to the flow of basic commodities such as grains and fertilisers. If disruption occurs, they must ensure that Africa is not the continent left behind while the wealthier world secures supplies.We write as African leaders who have acted to end vicious, destructive wars in our own countries and to pursue the establishment of credible, lasting peace. Such processes are fraught and difficult. Leadership is required to stay the course and keep talking even when your friends and allies want war to continue. Those in power must consider the consequences of their actions for humanity. And the watching world should push for a resolution in Ukraine. We hope one can be found before millions are harmed and killed in the developing world. The time for peace is always now.■Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is the former president of Liberia.

25,Why Z is for Putin,,08/03/22,"IN CYRILLIC, THE letter “Z” is written “З”. But since Vladimir Putin launched his latest invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, the Latin form has proliferated inside Russia. Just days after the invasion, Maria Butina, a Russian spy-turned-politician, filmed a video of herself drawing Z on her coat. “Keep it up, brothers,” she declared. “We’re with you forever.” The governor of Kemerovo, a coal-mining region in Siberia unofficially called “Kuzbass” (“Кузбасс”’ in Cyrillic), decreed that its name would henceforth be rendered in a Cyrillic-Latin mix as “КуZбасс”. Ivan Kuliak, a Russian gymnast, plastered a Z on his uniform when he took the podium beside a Ukrainian competitor at the Gymnastics World Cup in Qatar on March 5th, causing the International Gymnastics Federation to start disciplinary proceedings against him. Why has the letter Z become a symbol of support for Vladimir Putin’s war? As Russian forces assembled along Ukraine’s borders early this year, sharp-eyed observers of open-source intelligence noticed curious characters painted on the side of Russian tanks. Among them were the letter V, the letter Z inside a box, and a plain letter Z itself. The mysterious runes generated myriad theories: perhaps Z was shorthand for “zapad”, which means “west” in Russian (the direction Russian forces would be marching); maybe it indicated the Kremlin’s desire to take out Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Military analysts instead reckon that the letters correspond to particular parts of the Russian forces involved in the invasion. With more than 100 battalion tactical groups of between 600 and 1,000 troops from as far away as the Russian Far East operating in Ukraine, such markings may help to distinguish between them and their foes on the battlefield. Since the fighting began, Russia’s state propaganda machine has turned the Z into the operation’s unofficial logo. Russia’s defence ministry has suggested that it stands for “za”, the Russian word for “for”, as in “for victory”. RT, a Russian propaganda network, began hawking T-shirts emblazoned with the letter. Vladimir Solovyov, a noxious state television host, has it plastered on his laptop in his latest videos. Pro-war graffiti spotted in Ekaterinburg, a mid-sized city on the edge of Siberia, features the letter prominently. Nationalist activists in Moscow organised a caravan of cars with Zs painted on them to circle the city. A children’s hospice in Kazan, a city in western Russia, lined patients up in a Z formation for a photograph. Expressing his support for Mr Putin, the director of the charity that runs the hospice, Vladimir Vavilov, told a local news agency that the “fascist” force in Ukraine, as Mr Putin has labelled the country’s democratically elected leadership, “can only be stopped with force, there is no other way, no mercy!” The Z’s adoption several days into the operation suggests the planning for Russia’s information war may have been just as haphazard as the shooting war plans appear to have been. There is a particular irony to making a Latin letter the symbol of a war that Mr Putin has justified in part by spurious claims that the Russian language was under threat in Ukraine. The Z has never been associated with Mr Putin’s regime before, and has none of the long-cultivated symbolism of other notorious icons, such as the Nazi swastika, to which Ukraine’s defence minister has compared it. Yet the Z has already become a chilling shorthand. Opposition figures and others who have spoken out against the war inside Russia say they have found the letter scrawled on their apartments; agents from Russia’s security services left a Z inside the office of Memorial, a storied human-rights group, following a raid of the premises. Russian officials have adopted it to demonstrate allegiance to their leader. More than anything, Z is now for Putin. ■Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found here.More from The Economist explains:What is a no-fly zone?Has Vladimir Putin committed war crimes in Ukraine?What is the Wagner Group, Russia’s mercenary organisation?The Reedy Creek Improvement District, set up in 1967, is an American curiosity—and made Disney World possibleThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest country"
26,Andrey Kortunov offers three scenarios for the end of the war in Ukraine,,20/05/22,"THE MILITARY confrontation between Russia and Ukraine is not an ethnic conflict: ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians are fighting on both sides of the frontline. And radical nationalism is not the main motivation for Ukrainian resistance—contrary to many of Moscow’s statements. Neither is it a fight about religion. Both Russia and Ukraine are essentially secular states, and the recent religious renaissance in the two countries is superficial. Nor is the fight mostly about territory, in my view (though related disputes remain a formidable obstacle to reaching a peace settlement).The conflict concerns a clash between very different ways of organising social and political life within two countries which together once constituted a large portion of Soviet territory. It is also an intellectual and spiritual confrontation between two mindsets: two views on the modern international system and on the world at large; two opposing perceptions of what is right and what is wrong, what is fair and what is not, what is legitimate and what is illegitimate and of what national leadership should entail. It would be hard to argue that Ukraine has already emerged as a model of Western-style liberal democracy. But the country is persistently moving in this direction—slowly, inconsistently and with understandable setbacks and inevitable procrastination. Russia, in turn, is not a classical Asian or European authoritarian state, but it has been drifting away from the liberal democratic model for at least the past 20 years. Ukrainian society generally is organised from the bottom up, while Russian society has a top-down process at its core. Since independence in 1991, for example, Ukraine has elected six presidents. Each won power after highly contested (and sometimes very dramatic) elections. In the same period Russia has been ruled by only three heads of state. Each new leader was carefully selected and supported by his predecessor. Historians, cultural anthropologists and sociologists debate the reasons for this remarkable divergence. The most important thing, however, is that this fundamental incompatibility of the two models of social organisation has led not only to a horrendous fratricidal military confrontation in the very centre of Europe, but that it will also dictate how each side acts in the conflict. From personnel to propaganda and from strategy to statecraft, the two competing post-Soviet models are being put to the test. The outcome will have repercussions that go far beyond Europe.In Kyiv they can argue that the terms of the encounter are not fair. Russia is bigger, wealthier and militarily more powerful than Ukraine is. On the other hand, Ukraine enjoys international sympathy and almost unlimited defensive, economic, humanitarian and intelligence assistance from the West. Russia can rely only on itself and is exposed to the pressure of increasingly painful sanctions. Many Russian experts are used to saying that the massive Western military and other support is the only reason why Ukraine has not yet crumbled or surrendered. But this narrative does not explain the sources of Ukraine’s motivation. Consider Afghanistan, where all the long-term large-scale military support from America and its partners did not prevent the Taliban’s unstoppable offensive last year. Though the two conflicts cannot be compared directly, the reality on the ground seems clear: whereas Afghans in 2021 were no longer motivated to fight for their country and for their values, Ukrainians in 2022 clearly are. The stakes in the conflict could hardly be higher. It is about the future of the international system and about the future of the world order. Most important, it is about our understanding of modernity itself and, consequently, about our preferred models of social and political development.There are three scenarios for how the war ends, and each would have enormous geopolitical consequences. If the Kremlin were to lose decisively in this epic standoff, we would probably see a re-emergence of the unipolar moment—the remaining opposition to this arrangement by Beijing notwithstanding. Although Ukraine might be unfinished business for Mr Putin, Russia’s status is itself unfinished business for many in the West. Triumph for Ukraine might lead to a tamed and domesticated Russia. A quiet Russia would allow the West to cope more easily with China, which would be the only major obstacle to liberal hegemony and the long-awaited “end of history”. If the conflict results with an imperfect but mutually acceptable settlement, the final outcome of the collision between the Russian and the Ukrainian models will be postponed. Fierce competition between the two models of social organisation will continue, but, I hope, in a less brutal mode. A less-than-perfect compromise between the West and Russia might be followed by a more important, and more fundamental, compromise between the West and China. If a deal with Mr Putin is possible, a deal with Xi Jinping would be a logical continuation. A rapprochement between China and the West would require more time, energy and political flexibility from the West, however. That would lead to a reformation of the global order, with major changes to the UN system, archaic norms of international public law and recalibrations at the IMF, the WTO and other bodies. If there is no agreement on Ukraine and the conflict endures through cycles of shaky ceasefires followed by new rounds of escalation, expect decay in global and regional bodies. Inefficient international institutions may collapse amid an accelerating arms race, nuclear proliferation and the multiplication of regional conflicts. Such change would lead only to more chaos in the years ahead.Assessing the probability of any of the three scenarios is extremely difficult—too many independent variables could influence the outcome of the conflict. I consider the reformation scenario, in which an agreement is made to end the war, to be the best option for all. The others either will introduce change too quickly or block badly-needed change; in both cases political risks will multiply. If the conflict triggers a gradual, orderly and non-violent transition in which the global order becomes more stable, it would mean that humankind has not let Ukraine’s sacrifices go to waste. ■_______________Andrey Kortunov is a political scientist and director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Russian think-tank.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the By Invitation section of the print edition under the headline ""Andrey Kortunov offers three scenarios for the end of the war in Ukraine""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The banking system would be stronger without it, argues the investment bankerStorytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopherLike Zionism itself, the state has become a settler-colonial movement, argues the academic and author"
27,The war in Ukraine has battered the reputation of Russian spies,,09/10/22,"Editor’s note (October 26th 2022): On October 24th Norway’s domestic security agency arrested a suspected Russian spy who—just as in the example we give below—was purporting to be a Brazilian migrant. The suspected Russian agent had been researching Arctic security at the University of Tromso, in Norway’s far north. He is said to have been operating under the alias “José Assis Giammaria” and came to the university with solid references from the University of Calgary, in Canada. His Norwegian colleagues told reporters he was “friendly”, “asked a lot of questions, including questions of personal nature,” and that he had a “funny accent”. His arrest comes days after Norway arrested another Russian on suspicion of flying drones or taking photographs in the country’s Arctic north. All three cases illustrate, as we explain below, the increasing risks that Russian agents are taking. This is why so many are being caught.VIKTOR MULLER FERREIRA was a young Brazilian with impressive credentials and a big break. Fresh from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC, an incubator of talent for America’s national-security elite, he had secured an internship at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. But when he landed in Amsterdam in April, he was quickly deported to Brazil. Mr Ferreira was, in fact, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, an intelligence officer working for the GRU, Russia’s military-intelligence service.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Mr Cherkasov was a so-called illegal, of the sort depicted in the popular television series “The Americans”—an officer dispatched abroad under an elaborate foreign identity, often for life. In a four-page document obtained by Dutch intelligence, an aide-memoire of sorts, his cover story was laid out in painstaking detail, down to childhood crushes and favoured restaurants. Mr Cherkasov is now languishing in a Brazilian prison, sentenced to 15 years.When the Soviet KGB was dissolved in 1991, it reappeared as the FSB, a domestic-security service, and the SVR, a foreign-intelligence agency. The GRU has endured in one form or another since 1918. These “special services” bask in the fearsome reputation of their tsarist and Soviet forebears. But they emerge from the war in Ukraine with that reputation, and their networks, in tatters. The explosion which damaged the Kerch bridge on October 8th was only the latest security foul-up; Ukrainian operatives are also suspected of having orchestrated a car-bombing in Moscow in August which killed the daughter of a prominent Russian ultra-nationalist ideologue, according to the New York Times. Intelligence failure lies at the heart of the war. The FSB, the lead agency for protecting Russian secrets and spying in Ukraine, bungled both tasks in spectacular fashion. It failed to stop America from obtaining, and then publicising, Russian war plans for Ukraine—the most dramatic deployment of intelligence since America’s exposure of Soviet missiles on Cuba in 1962. Worse still, it was the FSB’s own conspicuous preparations for war—including plans to kill dissidents and install a puppet government—that helped convince American and British officials that the Russian military build-up was not a bluff.Vladimir Putin’s decision to go to war in the first place also owed much to the FSB’s bungling. The agency’s Fifth Service, responsible for ex-Soviet countries, expanded its Ukraine team dramatically in July 2021, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. Yet its officers largely spoke to those Ukrainians who were sympathetic to Russia and exaggerated the scale of their agent networks in the country, giving the Kremlin the false impression that the Ukrainian government would quickly collapse. Confirmation bias was only part of the problem. Intelligence agencies reflect the societies they come from. At their best, Russian spies can be top-notch. “We’ve consistently been surprised by the cleverness and relentlessness of some of the things that they do,” says John Sipher, who served as the CIA’s station chief in Moscow and later ran its Russia operations. “They have really, really smart people.”But that talent co-exists with venality and dysfunction. Intelligence is embellished as it rises up the chain, with bad news stripped out before it reaches the Kremlin. A Western official describes how, in one GRU unit, officers are thought to have skimmed off 30% of the salaries of the agents they recruited. That figure rose to 50% as the officers gradually had to spend more time padding out reports with information culled from the internet. The great strength of Russian intelligence is its sheer scale. Yet only a fraction of its personnel do useful spywork. It was FSB officers who poisoned Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, with Novichok, a nerve agent, in 2020. Nothing encapsulates the dual ethos of repression and larceny better than the fact that the FSB’s most sought-after position is the chief of the Fourth Service, a division responsible for “economic security”. Its officers are placed in key companies, giving them ample opportunity to enrich themselves.Infighting within the agencies, and with other government departments, is rife. “The FSB is like the Game of Thrones,” says Maxim (not his real name), a former FSB counterintelligence officer. “You have different clans inside with different political and financial interests.” The SVR, a descendant of the First Chief Directorate, the KGB’s foreign-intelligence arm, considers itself a cut above its sister services. But the war has left it battered. Western countries have expelled over 400 suspected Russian intelligence officers since the spring, eliminating nearly half of those operating under diplomatic cover in Europe. Those remaining face heightened scrutiny by local security services.A recent report by SUPO, Finland’s intelligence service, notes that Russian intelligence officers there have mostly been “severed” from their networks. It warns that Russian spies are resorting to alternative means. One is cyber-espionage. Another is the recruitment of foreigners within Russia. A third, which SUPO does not mention, is to lean more heavily on illegals like Mr Cherkasov. But that comes at a cost. The pressure on illegals is driving them to take greater risks than usual, according to European intelligence officials. In March, for instance, Poland arrested Pablo González, a Spanish-Russian journalist also known as Pavel Rubtsov, on suspicion of working for the GRU. A Ukrainian source says he was attempting to enter Ukraine to access a cyber unit in one of the country’s intelligence agencies (Mr Rubtsov denies the charges). Mr Cherkasov might have targeted the ICC because it had opened an investigation into war crimes in Ukraine. Their exposure will be keenly felt. Illegals are hugely expensive to train and deploy. The SVR is thought to have 50 to 100 deployed illegals, and the GRU only between ten and 20, according to sources familiar with those programmes.In many ways, Russian spies face the same professional challenges as their Western counterparts. It is becoming increasingly difficult to cross borders under multiple names, given the ubiquity of biometric controls, or build a digital backstory that stands up to scrutiny. Paying and communicating with agents is another challenge. But whereas Western spies have learnt how to blend into the noise, Russian ones have been slow to adapt. Illegals still use the dated technique of appropriating the identity of a dead baby (familiar to readers of “The Day of the Jackal”, a novel published in 1971.) Sloppiness abounds. Data leaked from a Russian food-delivery service in March exposed the names of FSB and GRU officers having food sent to their respective headquarters. That would not matter so much if Russian intelligence were not under intense scrutiny. Ever since the GRU’s attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, a former officer, in Salisbury, an English city, in 2018, Western allies have shared increasing amounts of intelligence on Russian spooks. Though it was Dutch intelligence that exposed Mr Ferreira, the operation was a joint endeavour that relied on America, Ireland and others.There has been little accountability for all this bungling. Western officials say they cannot confirm rumours that Sergei Beseda, the head of the FSB’s Fifth Service, was arrested in Russia in March. There are no proven job losses at senior level. That reflects the privileged status of the siloviki (securocrats) in the Russian state. Mr Putin does not trust his spies—he is said to be bypassing Alexander Bortnikov, the FSB’s chief, and talking to department heads—but it would be unwise to pick a fight with them just as his regime is experiencing an upswell of popular discontent over the drafting of hundreds of thousands of young Russian men to fight in Ukraine. On October 8th Mr Putin even placed the FSB in charge of security for the Kerch bridge.The result is likely to be more of the same bungling and sleaze. “You have a deep tradition of intelligence professionalism,” says Sir John Sawers, a former chief of MI6, “and like a gangrene on top of it is this growing corruption.” Maxim, the former FSB officer, agrees. “Back in the 1990s and 2000s there was a KGB touch to it. We stayed under the radar,” he says. The breaking point for him was when new graduates of the FSB academy were spotted driving a luxury Mercedes around Moscow. “They need to substitute this money world with something bigger. I’m not sure how they are going to do it.” ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Not-so-special services""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
28,Who are Russia’s supporters?,,04/04/22,"By invading ukraine, Vladimir Putin has divided the world. The West and its allies have presented a rare unified front against the Russian president’s attack. NATO is enjoying a surge of support within its member countries (and wannabe joiners). The EU has projected the role of a first-rate power. And co-ordinated efforts, including sanctions and banking restrictions, have punished Russia’s economy, at least in the short term. But from other countries Russia still enjoys some support. The Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company, has measured government actions globally since the war broke out, and countries’ historical ties with Russia, to divide the world into three broad categories: governments that are West-leaning, Russia-leaning and neutral amid the conflict.A total of 131 countries are against Russia, according to the analysis. Most rich ones in North America and Europe fall into this club. Even historically neutral governments, such as those in Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, have taken a decisive stance against the invasion. According to the EIU, the West-leaning camp accounts for more than 70% of the world’s GDP.But together the countries opposing Russia account for only 36% of the world’s population. Around two-thirds of people live in countries whose governments are either neutral or Russian-leaning. China and India, which together account for around one-third of the global population, skew the results. The Chinese government, classified as Russia-leaning by the EIU, has avoided direct condemnation of Mr Putin’s actions and is unlikely to stand with the West. India’s government, classed as neutral, has increased its engagement with the Russian government, especially through discounted oil prices. It is not just the governments of these hugely populous countries that are neutral or Russia-leaning. According to a survey in India conducted by YouGov, a pollster, in March, 40% of respondents approved of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fifty-four per cent of those polled approved of Mr Putin’s leadership (compared with 63% who approved of Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president). No such data have been collected in China but online polls indicate greater support for Russia. About 30% of the global population live in the 28 countries whose governments are classed by the EIU as leaning towards Russia. As well as China, these include such populous places as Pakistan and Ethiopia. For some, such as Eritrea and Syria, Russia is a key ally. Thirty-two governments have remained neutral, including Bangladesh’s, Brazil’s and India’s. Several developing countries see neutrality as the default foreign-policy choice, a legacy of the non-aligned movement formed during the cold war as a counterbalance against the world’s polarisation into two blocs.Mr Putin’s campaign in Ukraine has met widespread condemnation in the West. Recent evidence of war crimes could see Russia lose further support internationally. But for now by no means does everyone regard him, and his country, as pariahs. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

29,“Atlantis” envisaged the aftermath of a Russia-Ukraine war,,21/03/22,"SET IN 2025, “Atlantis” depicts the grim aftermath of a war between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine has prevailed, but at great cost. The groundwater is poisoned. Muddy landscapes are dotted with scarred buildings and rusted machinery. Workers in white bodysuits exhume corpses, enumerating details of the remains. Two shellshocked veterans of the war take turns shooting targets: the protagonist, Sergiy (Andriy Rymaruk), aims a final bullet, almost as an afterthought, square into his buddy’s protective vest, knocking him to the ground.With “Atlantis”, Valentyn Vasyanovych turned the bleak aftershocks of war into visual poetry. Later Sergiy’s friend, a steelworker, steps off a balcony into a cauldron of molten metal; visually, the tableau is as beautiful as an Old Master painting. The film’s 108 minutes consist of just 28 shots. Most are wide. In only a few does the camera, which was operated by Mr Vasyanovych, move.Filming took place in and near Ukraine’s eastern city of Mariupol in 2018, four years after Russia seized Crimea and began to foment a separatist war nearby. After editing a rough cut, Mr Vasyanovych deemed the film incomplete. It took six more months to devise a handful of additional scenes. One of them became the film’s emotional peak—a kiss between Sergiy and a paramedic who volunteers to identify bodies with Black Tulip, a Ukrainian organisation that does that in real life. “Atlantis”, which cost $1.2m to make, had its premiere in Venice in 2019 and has won a series of awards at film festivals around the world. The picture delighted critics and was chosen as Ukraine’s entry to the Academy Awards (though it was not nominated). But, says Vladimir Yatsenko, co-owner of ForeFilms, one of the production companies which made the movie, sales had been weak before the current war. That has changed in the wake of Russia’s invasion: the onslaught has stoked interest in, and sympathy for, Ukraine. The country’s fierce resistance has led some to believe the military underdog might actually prevail. This is lending the film a “prophetic” status, says Charles Bin of Best Friend Forever, a Brussels sales agent. As a result, distributors have registered their interest and “Atlantis” is now available on several streaming services, including Amazon Prime, HBO Max, iTunes and MUBI. The film will soon appear in cinemas in Japan and, on April 11th, in Italy.Today, Messrs Vasyanovych and Yatsenko are filming war documentaries in and near Kyiv, where they live. They are prepared to fight. “We can’t just run because we don’t have any other country,” Mr Yatsenko says. He has been instructed in the use of NLAW guided missiles, an anti-tank weapon donated to Ukraine by Britain. Mr Vasyanovych carries a Kalashnikov.Whatever the war’s outcome, “Atlantis” suggests that the scars will be deep. Mr Vasyanovych’s subsequent feature, “Reflection”, offers another such warning. That film, which had its premiere last year, bears an equally chilling message for Ukrainians at risk of subjugation by Russia: it is about torture in a secret prison run by Kremlin-backed separatists in a part of eastern Ukraine occupied since 2014.Numerous accounts of these dungeons have surfaced in real life. Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist who wrote a book about his torture and imprisonment in one such institution on charges of espionage, worked as a consultant on the film. Ominously, America has recently said it has credible information that Russia has a hit list of Ukrainians “to be killed or sent to camps”. If such a list exists, Mr Yatsenko says, he and Mr Vasyanovych are probably on it.Despite critical acclaim, sales of “Reflection” have been “difficult, to be frank”, says Barbara Van Lombeek of The PR Factory, a firm promoting the film pro bono. For a movie with graphic scenes of what Mr Vasyanovych calls “medieval” torture, perhaps that is unsurprising. But with reports of Russian atrocities pouring out of Ukraine, it, too, may prove grimly relevant. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis“Clock” and “Dead Ringers” both revolve around fertility treatment and motherhoodDeath is even more of a spoiler than this columnJapan and Saudi Arabia test two different approaches"
30,Ukraine’s conflict with Russia is also financial,,21/01/17,"IN THE tense, uncertain days of late 2013, when Ukrainians filled Kyiv’s Independence Square in protest at their government’s turn towards Russia, the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, grabbed a lifeline. To bolster his resolve in resisting the demands of pro-EU protesters, Russia lent Ukraine $3bn in the form of a bond. Mr Yanukovych was subsequently ousted anyway. Russia and Ukraine went to war. The money was never paid back.So Russia took legal action against Ukraine. The bond was issued under English law, and a hearing began this week in London. Those on the Ukrainian side say the country has no case to answer. In 2015 a group of creditors agreed to a debt restructuring on favourable terms: Russia refused to take part. And Russia made it harder for Ukraine to repay the bond by annexing Crimea and stoking war in the Donbass region. Moreover, it has fiddled with gas supplies to the country and slapped on trade sanctions. In 2013-15 Ukraine’s GDP dropped by 15%. The purchasing power of ordinary folk has fallen far more. In 2013 eight hryvnias bought one American dollar; it now takes more than 25.It is not clear, however, that English courts, which pride themselves on their political impartiality, would wish to rule definitively that Russia was responsible for Ukraine’s economic woes. Awkwardly, Ukraine continued to pay interest on the bond in part of 2015, when it was in the depths of recession. And Crimea was reliant on subsidies from the Ukrainian government. So Russia’s annexation, perversely, may have made it easier in some respects for Ukraine to repay the bond.The legal spat comes as the Ukrainian economy is looking stronger. The weak hryvnia is helping to lift exports; in October the IMF predicted 2.5% growth in GDP for 2017. A building boom is under way in Kyiv and the shopping malls off Independence Square are now filled with people eating noodles and hamburgers. A few months ago Uber, a car-hailing app, launched in Kyiv. Markets do not seem overly concerned by the prospect of a pro-Russian Donald Trump becoming American president: the hryvnia has weakened only slightly since November.Were $3bn eventually extracted from Ukraine as a result of the Russian lawsuit, however, the hryvnia would come under renewed pressure. Repaying Russia would also infuriate ordinary Ukrainians. Already, the next few years look tough. To service other dollar debts Ukraine will have to fork out about $15bn in 2017-20—an amount roughly equivalent to its current reserves of foreign exchange. Should those reserves fall below about $10bn, investors will start to worry about the country’s financial health. Ukraine’s bail-out programme with the IMF, agreed in 2015, should soften the blow, but it is behind schedule. Last year Ukraine received just $1bn in disbursements from the fund.Bond repayment or no bond repayment, Ukraine’s economic to-do list is daunting. Far-reaching reforms are needed to stamp out corruption and improve the rule of law. Some progress has been made. The recent nationalisation of the nation’s biggest lender, the struggling PrivatBank, has maintained financial stability, says Tomas Fiala of Dragon Capital, an investment bank based in Kyiv. Raising heavily subsidised gas prices has improved the finances of the state monopoly, Naftogaz.These positives aside, however, reform momentum has slowed recently. Hopes that Ukraine’s market for agricultural land would be thrown open to foreign investors have been dashed. Ukraine’s sprawling pension system needs change: spending on public pensions is worth 13% of GDP, extremely high by international standards.Popular disillusionment has set in about the government’s reformist zeal. Elena Besedina of the Kyiv School of Economics points out that no big names from the old regime have been thrown in jail for their wrongdoing. GDP per person is less than a tenth of America’s, yet luxury-car dealers and fashion boutiques still do a surprisingly brisk trade. With elections scheduled for 2019, populist vote-winning measures will doubtless be wheeled out. And this time, Russia will not be financing any part of the bill.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""The other war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Regulators arrange a deal for the California-based lenderThat is the popular narrative.

31,Lessons from Russia’s cyber-war in Ukraine,,30/11/22,"Shaping the battlefield. Darius, king of Persia, did it in 331BC, with caltrops strewn where he thought his enemy Alexander the Great would advance. The Allies did it in 1944, with dummy aircraft and landing craft intended to fool Germany’s high command into thinking their invasion of France would be in the Pas de Calais, not Normandy. And Russia attempted it on February 24th, when, less than an hour before its tanks started rolling into Ukraine—on their way, they thought, to Kyiv—its computer hackers brought down the satellite communications system run by Viasat, an American firm, on which its opponents were relying.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Victor Zhora, head of Ukraine’s defensive cyber-security agency, said in March that the result was “a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war”. A Western former security official reckoned it took “a year or two of really, really serious preparation and effort”. Win some, lose some. The Allies won. The D-day landings were successful. Darius lost, and lost his throne. Likewise, Russia’s advance on Kyiv was repelled. Its invasion force in that theatre was defeated. Despite the effort expended on trying, Russia could not generate a sufficiently thick fog of war through cyberwarfare. And that is interesting. Though cyberwarfare has been a hard-fought and important part of a conflict that has acted as a testing ground for this still-novel form of battle, it does not seem to have been the killer app, as it were, that some expected.Russia’s attack on Viasat was not the only softening-up-by-software it directed at Ukraine in the run-up to the invasion. In January, and again on February 23rd, so-called “wiper” programs, designed to delete data, were spotted on hundreds of Ukrainian systems. Then, in April, as the forces that had threatened Kyiv fled, hackers working for Sandworm (suspected to be a front for GRU, Russia’s military-intelligence service), used malware called Industroyer2 to attack the country’s electricity grid. Assaults of this sort on civilian infrastructure are hard to keep quiet. But what is happening to military kit is a different matter. Ukraine’s armed forces have maintained tight operational security throughout the war, giving away nothing about how their own networks were penetrated or disrupted (which they were). Even so, the visible effects of Russia’s campaign have been surprisingly limited. “I think we were expecting much more significant impacts than what we saw,” said Mieke Eoyang, a senior cyber-official at the Pentagon, on November 16th. “Russian cyber-forces as well as their traditional military forces underperformed expectations.”In the first days of the war, Ukraine stayed largely online. The lights remained on, even as fighting raged around the capital. The banks were open. Unlike 2015 and 2016, when cyber-attacks caused blackouts, electricity continued to flow. So did information. There was never a serious threat to Volodymyr Zelensky’s nightly presidential broadcasts to the Ukrainian people. If Russia’s aim was to undermine Ukrainians’ trust in their government and render the country ungovernable, it failed. The most important reason for that was Ukraine’s defence. Lindy Cameron, head of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reckons Russia’s onslaught was “probably the most sustained and intensive cyber-campaign on record”. But as Sir Jeremy Fleming, her boss at GCHQ, Britain’s signals-intelligence agency (of which the NCSC is part) observed in an essay for The Economist in August, Ukraine’s response was “arguably…the most effective defensive cyber-activity in history”. Ukraine had been a test bed for Russian cyber-operations for years. Industroyer2’s predecessor, Industroyer, for example, was the cause of the blackouts in 2016. That gave the government insight into Russian operations, and time to harden its infrastructure.This meant that when the invasion began, Ukraine’s cyber-command had a contingency plan ready. Some officials dispersed from Kyiv to safer parts of the country. Others moved to command posts near the front lines. Crucial services were transferred to data centres elsewhere in Europe, beyond the reach of Russian missiles. Ukraine’s armed forces, aware that satellites might be disrupted, had prepared alternative means of communication. The attack on Viasat ultimately “had no tactical impact on Ukrainian military comms and operations”, insisted Mr Zhora in September, qualifying his earlier statement.Western assistance was also crucial. In the prelude to war, one way NATO enhanced its co-operation with Ukraine was by granting access to its cyberthreat library, a repository of known malware. Britain provided £6m ($7.3m) of support, including firewalls to block attacks and forensic capabilities to analyse intrusions. The co-operation was mutual. “It is likely that the Ukrainians taught the US and the UK more about Russian cyber-tactics than they learned from them,” notes Marcus Willett, a former head of cyber issues for GCHQ.Ukrainian resilience was helped, paradoxically, by the primitive nature of many of its industrial-control systems—inherited from Soviet days and not yet upgraded. When, for example, Industroyer hit electrical substations in Kyiv in 2016, engineers were able to reset systems with manual overrides within a few hours. When Industroyer2 took part of the grid offline in April, it came back on again in four hours. Private cyber-security companies have also played a prominent role. Mr Zhora singles out Microsoft and ESET, a Slovakian firm, as being particularly important for their large presence on Ukrainian networks and the “telemetry”, or network data, that they collect as a result. ESET provided the intelligence which helped Ukrainian cyber-teams parry Industroyer2. Microsoft says that artificial intelligence, which can scan through code more quickly than a human being, has made it easier to detect attacks. On November 3rd Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, announced that his firm would extend tech support to Ukraine until the end of 2023 free of charge. The pledge brought the value of Microsoft’s support to Ukraine since February to more than $400m.There is no doubt that Ukraine was a hard target. But there are those who wonder whether Russia’s cyber-prowess might have been overrated. Russian spies have decades of experience with cyber-espionage, but the country’s military cyber-forces are “very young” compared with Western rivals, notes Gavin Wilde, a former director of Russia policy on America’s national security council. America began integrating cyber-plans into military operations during wars in Haiti and Kosovo in the 1990s. Russia has thought about it for only around six years, says Mr Wilde. American, European and Ukrainian officials all say that there are many examples of Russian cyber-attacks synchronised with physical attacks, suggesting a degree of co-ordination between the two branches. But there have also been clumsy errors. Sir Jeremy says that, in some cases, Russian military strikes took down the same networks that Russian cyber-forces were attempting to infect—ironically forcing the Ukrainians to revert to more secure means of communication. Others paint Russia as a sloppy cyber-power—good at breaking things, but loud and imprecise. In April David Cattler, NATO’s top intelligence official, observed that Russia had used more destructive malware against Ukraine “than the rest of the world’s cyber-powers combined typically use in a given year”. But judging a cyber-campaign by the volume of malware is like rating infantry by the number of bullets fired. Daniel Moore, author of “Offensive Cyber Operations”, a recent book on the subject, says that every single one of Russia’s known attacks on critical infrastructure, in Ukraine and beyond, has been prematurely exposed, been riddled with errors or has spilled over beyond the intended target—as was the case with NotPetya, a self-spreading ransomware attack of 2017, which escaped from Ukraine to cause $10bn of damage around the world.“There were significant operational failings in almost every single attack that they have ever carried out in cyberspace,” says Mr Moore. In contrast, he points to Stuxnet, an Israeli-American cyber-attack on an Iranian nuclear facility, first identified 12 years ago—technologically, ancient history. “That was far more complex than a lot of what we see from Russia today.” Some Western spies thus say the war shows a gulf between American and Russian proficiency in high-end cyber-operations against military hardware. But others warn that it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions. Russia’s cyber-campaign may have been constrained less by incapacity than by the hubris that also afflicted its conventional armed forces. Western officials say that Russia failed to plan and launch highly destructive cyber-attacks on power, energy and transport not because it was unable to do so, but because it assumed it would soon occupy Ukraine and inherit that infrastructure. Why destroy what you will soon need? When the war dragged on instead, it had to adapt. But cyber-weapons are not like physical ones that can simply be wheeled around to point at another target and replenished with ammunition. Rather, they have to be tailored specifically to particular targets.Sophisticated attacks, like that on Viasat, require huge preparation, including painstaking reconnaissance of target networks. In a paper published last year, Lennart Maschmeyer of ETH Zurich showed that GRU’s attack on Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 had taken 19 months of planning, while that in 2016 had required two and a half years. Launching such attacks also reveals to an enemy the tools (ie, code) and infrastructure (servers) being used, resulting in attrition of their effectiveness. After the war’s first week, therefore, as Viasat-like set pieces were used up, Russian cyber-attacks grew more tactical and opportunistic. Then, in April, as Russia turned from Kyiv to the Donbas, the volume of wiper attacks dropped precipitously. In November, researchers at Mandiant, a cyber-security firm owned by Alphabet, described how GRU was now attacking “edge” devices such as routers, firewalls and email servers to speed up attacks, even at the expense of stealthiness.“What you’re seeing here is a production frontier,” says John Wolfram of Mandiant, referring to a graph in economic theory which shows the various combinations of two goods that can be produced with given resources. “You have a certain amount of expertise and capital, and you have to decide whether you spend it on one or two exquisite special operations—or 50 at lower cost.” Choosing the latter does not mean the former are beyond your capacity. “Russia is almost certainly capable of cyber-attacks of greater scale and consequence than events in Ukraine would have one believe,” notes Mr Cattler. The war “has not yet involved both sides using top-end offensive cyber-capabilities against each other”, agrees Mr Willett. If all this is true, those capabilities might yet be unleashed. The sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in September, and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, suggest that the Kremlin’s appetite for risk is growing. There are signs of this in the cyber-domain, too. One British official says that Russia, mindful of the NotPetya incident, was keen at first to confine its attacks to Ukraine, to avoid picking a fight with NATO. But that may be changing. In late September Sandworm launched the first intentional attack on targets in a NATO-country, with “Prestige”, a disruptive piece of malware that was directed at transport and logistics in Poland, a hub for arms supplies to Ukraine. There are also those who believe the power of cyberwarfare has been misunderstood. Cyber-operations have been “intense and important”, acknowledges Ciaran Martin, Ms Cameron’s predecessor at the NCSC. But the war has illustrated “the severe limitations of cyber as a wartime capability”, he says. Stuxnet, which infected Iranian systems that were “air gapped” (that is, physically disconnected from the internet), mechanically damaged machinery, yet remained undetected for months. Its success gave rise to a distorted view of cyber-attacks as wonder weapons, capable of substituting for bombs and missiles. In truth, argues Mr Martin, Stuxnet was the “Moon landing” of offensive cyber, an exquisite one-off that required superpower resources to execute rather than being a staple of cyberwars.Nor is cyber “some magic invisible battlefield where you can do stuff you can’t get away with normally”, says Mr Martin. Not only is it difficult to cause severe harm to well-defended computer networks, but such attacks, contrary to conventional wisdom, would be “easily attributed”. Cyber-offensives are not consequence-free. “Despite all the hype,” notes Mr Martin, “Putin has not seriously troubled the West at all in cyberspace since the invasion.” Adjudicating these debates and drawing lessons will take time and perspective. Many intrusions may have gone unnoticed. An attack on the Lviv regional military organisation was caught only at a late stage, for example—and the Russian toolset went largely unnoticed by commercial security software. Detecting attacks is not a foolproof science, says one Ukrainian cyber-security official. Often, there is a legitimate login to the system, when someone’s password is compromised. You only see symptoms, not cause. “It’s like someone presents with a cough, or low blood oxygen. We only now know that it could be covid. Malware is similar. We rarely detect it when it penetrates the network, only when we see anomalies. In most cases, we catch things only some time in the middle.”One further point is that the most destructive cyber-operations, like Stuxnet, are actually most useful in peacetime, when missiles are off the table. In war, munitions can often do the job more easily and cheaply. Probably, the most important wartime cyber-activity, on both sides, is that aimed at intelligence gathering or psychological warfare rather than destruction. A Ukrainian former politician in a position to know confirms that the most valuable contribution of the country’s cyber-forces is extracting secrets, such as details of European companies that are violating American sanctions on Russia. “There are some other things I can’t talk about, but it’s pretty impressive work,” he says. The Allied decryption of Germany’s Enigma cipher machines in the second world war did not come to light until the 1970s. The ultimate impact of cyber-operations in Ukraine may remain obscure for years. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.

32,How the war in Ukraine is accelerating Russia’s brain drain,,25/03/22,"POLAND AND GERMANY are among the European countries that have welcomed millions of desperate Ukrainian refugees. But Armenia, Georgia and Turkey, in particular, are learning to cope with another sort of refugee—Russians fleeing Russia. Since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24th, tens of thousands of Russians have hurriedly left their homes, travelling to any nearby destination that will allow them in visa-free; one prominent economist estimated that at least 200,000 had fled by the second week of March. Georgia alone has reportedly accepted about 30,000. This stampede for the exits greatly accelerates a trend that has been on the rise for years. Between 2000, when Vladimir Putin first became president, and 2019, 1.6m-2m Russians have left the country (out of a population of about 145m). These numbers are not in themselves surprising; in the turbulent decade after 1989 about 2.5m left. But since 2011-12 the rate of emigration has increased sharply (see chart)—and the profile of those leaving has changed dramatically. In 2012 Mr Putin took over the presidency again after an election marked by fraud and protests, confirming Russia’s authoritarian turn. Before then, those leaving did so mainly for economic reasons; afterwards, principally for political ones. A popular blog at the time was called “Pora valit”, meaning roughly “Time to shove off”. Thousands used it to exchange hints on how best to leave the country. In a survey conducted between 2017-18 by the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, 40% of emigrants who had left since 2000 cited the “general political climate” and 29% “persecution and poor human rights” as reasons to leave. Anecdotally, most of those who have left over the past month opposed the invasion of Ukraine. Some participated in protests. Moreover, the political climate has tended to repulse the brainiest Russians. Those who have left since 2000 were mostly aged between 25 and 45 and highly educated. The evidence available suggests the scale of the brain-drain. Of the hundreds surveyed by the Atlantic Council, 36% had a master’s degree or a doctorate. Laws passed by Mr Putin’s government to restrict the ability of scientists to collaborate internationally and to conduct public outreach have encouraged many on their way. Russian émigrés are behind some of the world’s most successful digital start-ups, such as Revolut, a mobile-banking app based in London co-founded by Nikolay Storonsky. It was valued at $33bn in 2021. Miro, a software publisher started by two Russian entrepreneurs, is now worth about $18bn. Those tech workers remaining in Russia have been among the most vocal opponents of the Ukraine war. Russia’s own Association for Electronic Communications, an industry body, says that up to 70,000 IT professionals have left since the war began and as many as 100,000 are expected to go in April. Many of them are now looking for lodgings in Tbilisi, Istanbul and Yerevan. Mr Putin won’t mourn the loss of what he calls a “fifth column” of traitors opposing the war, but the departure of wealth-creating, entrepreneurial talent will surely do further damage to an economy already reeling under sanctions. Thus, Mr Putin’s war threatens not only Ukraine’s future, but Russia’s too.Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereMore from The Economist explains:How will the loss of so many people change Ukraine?Could Vladimir Putin be prosecuted by a Nuremberg-style tribunal?The war in Ukraine, explained in mapsThe Reedy Creek Improvement District, set up in 1967, is an American curiosity—and made Disney World possibleThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest country"
33,Why is Eritrea backing Russian aggression in Ukraine?,,08/03/22,"WHEN RUSSIA invaded Ukraine most of the world reacted with horror: on March 2nd an overwhelming majority of countries supported a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression. But among the usual suspects who voted against it (Belarus, Syria, North Korea, Russia itself) one stood out. Eritrea, which was also the only country other than Russia to vote against a UN human-rights investigation in Ukraine, is a small and impoverished country with little to gain from resisting the tide of international opinion so flagrantly. So why is it backing Russia? Eritrea’s solidarity with an imperialist, revanchist Russia is at first glance surprising. As a young country long threatened by a bigger neighbour, it appears more like Ukraine. Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia, a much more powerful country to its south, in 1993—just a couple of years after Ukraine broke away from Russia. As in Ukraine, nationhood in Eritrea is seen as something fragile which cannot be taken for granted. It took decades of armed struggle against successive regimes in Ethiopia—first the imperial government of Emperor Haile Selassie, then a Soviet-backed Marxist junta known as the Derg—before a referendum on secession was approved. Five years later the two countries fought a bloody border war which cost perhaps 70,000 lives. Even today there are some in Ethiopia who question whether Eritrea is really a separate country at all. Part of the reason for Eritrea’s unlikely support for Russia lies in its leadership’s background in the liberation struggle. Unlike many African liberation movements in the 20th century, such as the African National Congress which fought apartheid in South Africa, the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) was not supported by the Soviet Union. In fact the Soviets armed the Derg and even sent military advisers to assist in the fight against it. But Gaim Kibreab, the author of a recent book on Soviet-Eritrean relations, argues that despite this “the EPLF always considered the Soviet Union as a strategic ally against imperialism, and saw America as its number one enemy.” Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Issaias Afewerki, the EPLF’s former leader and Eritrea’s dictator since independence, has continued to see himself as part of an axis of anti-Western powers led by Russia. More recent history helps to explain the intensity of Issaias’s hostility to the West. When war broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1998, the Eritrean president felt America and its allies had sided with Ethiopia. After a humiliating defeat Issais retreated into embittered isolation. He put Eritrea on a permanent war footing, bloating its huge army with lifetime conscripts. Hundreds of thousands of Eritreans fled the country. In 2009 the UN, nudged by America and its ally, the Ethiopian government, imposed an arms embargo (in part for Eritrea’s alleged support for jihadists in Somalia). Ironically, Eritrea had briefly courted America in the early 2000s and even publicly backed its invasion of Iraq. Feeling stung, Issais’s regime gradually drifted into being the most anti-Western in Africa. Eritrea’s controversial involvement in Ethiopia’s current civil war has set it on an even more confrontational path with the West. Eritrean troops are accused of slaughtering civilians, gang-raping women and blocking food from reaching the hungry. Tentative progress towards rehabilitating Issais’s regime, which culminated in the lifting of the arms embargo in late 2018, has screeched into reverse. In November last year America slapped sanctions on the Eritrean armed forces, the ruling party and connected entities. It has repeatedly called for Eritrean forces to withdraw from Ethiopia. By contrast, the threat of a Russian veto has consistently stymied action against Eritrea or Ethiopia at the UN Security Council. Ethiopia, which also has Mr Putin to thank for this, is now trying to mend bridges with the West in order to rebuild its war-battered economy. But Issais has no interest in foreign aid, seeing it as a Trojan horse for Western interference in his country’s affairs. Nor does he care much for promoting the private sector. More important from his perspective are arms and large, strategic investments which bring lucrative rents. Russia has promised to sell Eritrea weapons and to build a logistics base for its own navy on the Eritrean coast. And in Mr Putin Eritrea’s president has a fellow autocrat who prizes bashing the West, and meddling with his neighbours, above the well-being of his citizens. Viewed this way, the two leaders seem like comrades-in-arms.

34,How war in Ukraine is changing the Arctic,,04/07/22,"THE CHILL winds from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have reached the Arctic. On June 29th Russia’s foreign ministry said Norway would face “retaliatory measures” for imposing sanctions that block Russian goods destined for Svalbard, an Arctic archipelago. Svalbard is part of Norway, but a treaty from 1920 gives Russia the right to exploit its natural resources, and many of the settlements there are populated by Russians. Even before this squabble, Arctic powers had already clashed over the invasion. On March 3rd, just a week after war broke out, seven of the eight permanent members of the Arctic Council, the region’s main intergovernmental organisation—all bar Russia, the current chair—said they would boycott future meetings in light of the war. The council had long sought to portray the region as peaceful and co-operative: its founding document, the Ottawa Declaration of 1996, states that it should not deal with “military security”. But the war has pitted Western signatories (America, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) against Russia in the far north. How will the fallout affect the Arctic?Climate change is raising the stakes. The Arctic is warming three to four times faster than the global average. Minimum sea-ice cover in 2020 was almost 2.6m square kilometres smaller than the average minimum between 1981 and 2010. The environmental consequences are grave. But there are geopolitical ramifications too. Polar sea routes are becoming more easily navigable, natural resources newly accessible and northern frontiers increasingly vulnerable. Countries outside the region are turning their attention north. China has plans for a “polar silk road” and has invested more than $90bn in Arctic infrastructure and assets. War in Ukraine has drawn attention to the military threat Russia poses in the far north. Severomorsk, a port on the Barents Sea within the Arctic Circle, is the main base of the country’s Northern fleet, which includes nuclear-capable submarines. Remilitarisation was well under way before the war because Russia’s natural polar defence, ice, is melting away. It has built at least 475 military sites along its northern border in the past six years. War is unlikely to break out in the Arctic: the terrain is too hazardous and the rewards too slight. But it could be drawn into a wider conflict. Heeding the threat, NATO has turned its attention northwards too. In March Norway hosted NATO’s biggest Arctic military exercise in more than three decades. America is considering revamping its armed forces in Alaska. When Finland and Sweden join the alliance, all Arctic countries but Russia will be NATO members. Co-operation between Western and Russian scientists in the region has broken down. Research on climate change is the obvious victim. Business partnerships have also soured. Russia has invested heavily in oil and gas in the Arctic, announcing $300bn of incentives for new projects in 2020. But Western companies, including BP, ExxonMobil and Shell, are pulling out. Italy has frozen its $21bn of financing for the Arctic LNG 2, an extraction project in northern Siberia. This makes way for Chinese capital. China is already pumping money into Arctic extraction. It has a 30-year contract with Russia to import gas from the Yamal fields, in the Siberian Arctic, via Power of Siberia 2, a pipeline due to be constructed between the countries. State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has a 20% stake in Yamal LNG, a gas-extraction project; the country’s Silk Road Fund owns 10%. Other state-owned companies have also invested in Arctic LNG 2. And Russia will increasingly rely on Chinese technology to build Arctic liquefied natural gas tankers and other equipment, in place of Western firms. Russia is wary of China’s interest in the region, where it sees itself as pre-eminent. China has no Arctic territory but its growing influence is shifting the balance of power there. The pretence that the region could stay above geopolitics has broken down, says Andreas Osthagen, of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, near Oslo. Norway will take over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in 2023 and Western countries will need to decide whether to proceed without Russia. The new Arctic, much like the new world order, looks set to pit NATO members against China and Russia. ■More from The Economist explains:Where will Ukraine store its grain?How consumer drones are changing warfareIs Kaliningrad, Russia’s exclave surrounded by EU countries, an asset or a liability?The Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
35,Turkey’s rapprochement with Russia may not survive the war in Ukraine,,24/02/22,"TRAFFIC ON THE Bosporus, the waterway that splits Istanbul and connects the Marmara and Black seas, has been busier than usual of late, and more dangerous. Making their way past supertankers, passenger ferries and the occasional pod of dolphins are Russian warships heading north towards Ukraine. Since the start of February, at least six Russian amphibious assault ships, as well as a Kilo-class submarine, have passed through. Russia now has four such submarines in the Black sea, each armed with missiles capable of striking targets anywhere in Ukraine.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Few countries are watching the war for which these weapons were deployed as anxiously as Turkey. Its government, headed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is eager to preserve a recent rapprochement with Russia. “We cannot give up” on either Russia or Ukraine, Mr Erdogan said on February 23rd. But Russia’s actions may end up forcing his hand. The following day, as Russian bombs began falling on Ukraine, Turkey’s foreign ministry called the invasion “unacceptable” and “a grave violation of international law”. It had already denounced Russia’s recognition of separatist enclaves in Ukraine. The war will test the relationship, possibly to destruction.Turkey’s most immediate concern is its economy. Mr Erdogan, who has helped drive inflation to over 48% and maimed his currency with ill-judged interest-rate cuts, is eager for lots of foreign cash from a busy tourism season, lower energy prices and some measure of regional stability. Russia’s actions in Ukraine seem to have torpedoed such prospects. Russians and Ukrainians accounted for over a quarter of foreign visitors to Turkey last year. This summer, presumably, far fewer will show up. Western sanctions against Russia, one of Turkey’s main trading partners and its main supplier of natural gas, will deal the economy a separate blow. The war has already sent shudders through Turkish markets. On February 24th the lira was headed for its worst day this year.Turkey does not want to antagonise Russia. The last time it did so, by shooting down a Russian warplane near the border with Syria in 2015, the Russian response, a mix of sanctions and threats, was robust enough to force a rare apology and a range of concessions from Mr Erdogan. What followed was a thaw in relations, marked by new energy deals, co-operation in Syria, and Turkey’s purchase of an S-400 air defence system from Russia. Russia has since tried to peel away Turkey from NATO, while Turkey, estranged from its Western partners, has looked to Russia to advance its regional interests.Remarkably, the rapprochement has survived the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey, as well as wars in Libya, Syria and Azerbaijan in which Turkey’s proxies have squared off against Russia’s. The two powers co-operate whenever possible and confront each other where necessary, though almost never directly. “It’s like capoeira,” says a European diplomat, referring to a stylised Brazilian martial art. “Each side is doing its dance, sizing up the other, but there’s always the danger they will come to blows.” When they do, one of them (usually Turkey) finds a way to scale back. When a Russian airstrike killed dozens of Turkish troops stationed in Syria in 2020, Mr Erdogan ordered a bombing campaign against Syrian regime forces, but not Russian positions. Turkey has also been silent about Russia’s antics in Belarus.But Turkey considers Ukraine a strategic partner. It opposed Russia’s annexation of Crimea, backed Ukraine’s plans to join NATO, and shared its concerns about Russia’s naval build-up in the Black sea. Turkey also sold Ukraine dozens of armed drones, vexing Mr Putin. Earlier this year, Mr Erdogan and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, signed a new defence co-operation agreement. The war will make it difficult for Turkey to balance its commitments as a member of NATO and its warm relations with Russia, says Alper Coskun of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank in America.Turkey’s backing for Ukraine has already helped the country buff its tarnished NATO credentials. American diplomats, used to taking Turkey to task for its human-rights record, are praising its stance on Ukraine. It helps that Turkey has begun to mend fences with the UAE, Egypt and Israel, all of them American allies.Russia has ways of tempering Turkey’s support for Ukraine, however. Nowhere is this as clear as in Idlib, a province in north-east Syria packed with over 3m civilians and controlled by Islamic extremists. Two years ago, Turkey, which backs the insurgents, and Russia, which backs the Syrian regime, agreed to a ceasefire. That stopped a regime offensive that would have pushed the insurgents and millions of refugees towards Turkey’s border. Since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, ceasefire violations have picked up, officials in Ankara say. This is not a coincidence. They believe Russia is weaponising the refugees against Turkey. “The Russians see Idlib as a soft spot for Turkey,” says one official. “They’re sending a message, that if we do something they don’t like [in Ukraine], they can make our lives difficult.”Mr Erdogan said earlier this year that Turkey would do whatever is necessary as a NATO member in the event of a Russian invasion. But in practice there is only so much Turkey is prepared to do for Ukraine. Recently one of the prime minister’s top advisers suggested that Turkey would not align with foreign sanctions against Russia, calling them “useless”. Instead Turkey had tried to position itself as a possible mediator between Russian and Ukraine—a notion that now seems naive. Mr Erdogan would have loved to preserve cosy ties with Russia, but the war in Ukraine is likely to prove the end of the affair. ■This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Frenemies""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
36,The military gap between Russia and Ukraine is vast,,25/02/22,"As russia continues to wage war in Ukraine, the fighting has not been as one-sided as might have been expected. Despite being outgunned and outnumbered, Ukraine inflicted more casualties in 24 hours than Russia suffered over eight years of engagements in Syria. Ukraine’s anti-tank weapons have presented serious resistance to Russia’s advances in the north and east. This may strike some as surprising. On paper, Ukraine’s military budget is smaller than that of city-state Singapore. But nominal spending figures dramatically understate some countries’ capabilities, by failing to account for the fact that military costs vary. To compare capabilities fairly, Peter Robertson of the University of Western Australia has devised “military purchasing power parity (PPP)”. This adjusts defence budgets for how they are allocated among wages, operating costs and equipment, and how local prices vary in each of these areas. Use these figures, and the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian spending shrinks. Wages in both Ukraine and Russia are lower than in America, the benchmark for the calculations. Construction and maintenance are cheaper as well. But Ukraine spends a higher share of its budget on wages—which are lower than in America and Russia—than it does on kit, which is more even in cost. In nominal terms its total defence spending is 9.6% of Russia’s. Adjusted for costs, that figure more than doubles to 20.6%. Military PPP ratios are not perfect. Some guesswork is required when estimating both total spending and the proportion of resources going to different areas. Aid from outside, often given in kind, is hard to score. Some military assets provide value for years, and some, such as nuclear weapons, have a quality all of their own. But so, too, does leadership—and the will to fight. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

37,"As war looms larger, what are Russia’s military options in Ukraine?",,22/01/22,"“WHAT STANDS in front of us, what could be weeks away, is the first peer-on-peer, industrialised, digitised, top-tier army against top-tier army war that’s been on this continent for generations,” warned James Heappey, Britain’s junior defence minister, on January 19th, pointing to Russia’s build-up of over 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. “Tens of thousands of people could die.” Estonia’s defence chief echoed the warning. “Everything is moving towards armed conflict,” he said.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, is due to meet Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, in Geneva on January 21st. But the prospects for diplomacy are dim. On January 19th Sergei Ryabkov, one of Mr Lavrov’s deputies, said that even a 20-year moratorium on NATO membership for Ukraine would not satisfy Russia. In recent weeks, Russia has mobilised reservists and dispatched troops and missiles from as far away as the North Korean border.Western countries are bracing for the worst. On January 17th Britain began airlifting thousands of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Days earlier Sweden rushed armoured vehicles to the island of Gotland as three Russian landing craft passed through the Baltic Sea, destination unknown. The same day, Ukraine was struck by cyber-attacks which defaced government websites and locked official computers. Meanwhile, the White House said it had intelligence showing that Russia was planning staged acts of sabotage against its own proxy forces in eastern Ukraine to provide a pretext for attacking the country.Such an attack could take many forms. One possibility is that Russia would simply do openly what it has done furtively for seven years: send troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk “republics”, breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, either to expand their boundaries westward or to recognise them as independent states, as it did after sending forces into Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Georgian regions, in 2008.Another scenario, widely discussed in recent years, is that Russia might seek to establish a land bridge to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014. That would require seizing 300km (185 miles) of territory along the Sea of Azov, including the key Ukrainian port of Mariupol, up to the Dnieper river.Such limited land-grabs would be well within the capabilities of the forces mustering in western Russia. What is less clear is whether they would serve the Kremlin’s war aims. If Russia’s objective is to bring Ukraine to its knees and prevent it from joining NATO or even co-operating with the alliance, simply consolidating control over Donbas or a small swathe of land in southern Ukraine is unlikely to achieve it.To do so would require imposing massive costs on the government in Kyiv—whether by decimating its armed forces, destroying its critical national infrastructure or overthrowing it altogether. One option would be for Russia to use “stand-off” weapons without troops on the ground, emulating NATO’s air war against Serbia in 1999. Strikes by rocket launchers and missiles would wreak havoc. These could be supplemented by more novel weapons, such as cyber-attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure like the ones which disrupted the country’s power grid in 2015 and 2016.The problem is that such punitive campaigns tend to last longer and prove harder than they first appear. If war comes, stand-off strikes are more likely to be a prelude and accompaniment to a ground war rather than a substitute for it. “I don’t see a lot between them and Kyiv that could stop them,” says David Shlapak of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank.The aim would probably be to hurt Ukraine, not occupy it. The country is as large and populous as Afghanistan, and since 2014 over 300,000 Ukrainians have gained some form of military experience; most have access to firearms. American officials have told allies that the Pentagon and CIA would both support an armed insurgency.Russia might consider what America’s army calls a “thunder run”, says Mr Shlapak, a swift and deep assault on a narrow front, intended to shock and paralyse the enemy rather than seize territory. And an attack need not come solely from the east.On January 17th Russian troops, some from the far east, began arriving in Belarus, ostensibly for military exercises scheduled for February. Russia has said it will also send a dozen warplanes and two S-400 air-defence systems. An attack from the north, over the Belarus-Ukraine border, would allow Russia to approach the Ukrainian capital from the west and encircle it.“Once they’re within rocket range of downtown Kyiv,” asks Mr Shlapak, “is that a situation the Ukrainians want to live with?” Even if Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, is willing to tolerate a siege, Russia may gamble that his government will simply collapse—and it may use spies, special forces and disinformation to hasten that process.Wars, though, unfold in unpredictable ways. Russia has not fought a large-scale offensive involving infantry, armour and air power since the climactic battles of the second world war. Countries under attack can just as easily stand firm as fall apart. Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International Affairs Council warns of a “long and sluggish confrontation” that would be “fraught with destabilisation of…Russia itself”.Even victory would be costly. “The Ukrainians will fight and inflict major losses on the Russians,” says Peter Zwack, a retired general who was America’s defence attaché in Moscow during the Kremlin’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “This is going to be hard for Russia—and they are basically alone.” Coupled with the threat of heavy sanctions being prepared by America and its European allies, and the apparent absence of any domestic support for a new adventure, all this may, even now, be giving Mr Putin pause for thought. ■Dig deeperRussia and the West meet for a crucial week of diplomacy (Jan 2022)Ukrainians are peculiarly relaxed about Russia’s troop build-up (Jan 2022)Russia’s menacing of Ukraine is unlikely to induce NATO to retreat (Jan 2022)Why Russia has never accepted Ukrainian independence (Dec 2021)This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""The guns of January""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
38,Russian war criminals may never be brought to justice,,08/04/22,"EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN war crimes litters Ukraine, but however much Ukrainians and some Russians wish differently, no one—least of all Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president—is likely to spend a single day in prison for them. Nonetheless, it is important that the atrocities are investigated. This is partly to commemorate those who were tortured, raped and murdered. It is also to expose the Kremlin’s lies to a world too inclined to let them pass. And public indictments of Russian troops would serve as a warning that may help deter the next round of killing.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Ukraine’s prosecutor-general said on April 3rd that 410 civilians had been killed around Kyiv. Many more bodies will be found. The Economist saw the corpse of the mayor of Motyzhyn, a suburb, blindfolded and shot, apparently by Russian forces, along with her family. We heard details of the murder of Ukrainian men in Bucha, ordered by a Russian commander. Human Rights Watch, a charity, reports that Russian soldiers threw a smoke grenade into a basement in Vorzel, near Irpin, then shot a woman and her child as they emerged.Evidence like this has rightly caused a worldwide outcry. Ukraine’s president and Poland’s prime minister have accused Russia of genocide. Joe Biden, America’s president, has called the enormities in Bucha a war crime. And the UN secretary general asked for an investigation into the killings, alongside the several already under way.Investigators are likely to find that Russian forces should be indicted, even if they have not killed on such a systematic scale as to have committed genocide. The Geneva Conventions, which Russia has signed, outlaw war crimes, including wilful killing, causing great suffering and targeting civilians. The murders in Bucha would count. So would the bombing of the Mariupol theatre on which the Russian word for children was written large enough for targeters to see from the sky. Russia’s invasion was itself a crime of aggression, as defined by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which tries individuals for actions under international law. And Russia’s vast and indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities is a crime against humanity, defined by the ICC as participation in and knowledge of “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”.Unfortunately, indictments are unlikely to bring Russian war criminals to justice. Having been thrown out of the Council of Europe on March 16th after the invasion, Russia has started ignoring the European Court of Human Rights. Neither since 2016 has it recognised the ICC. That does not stop the ICC bringing a case or issuing arrest warrants against Russians, but enforcement needs the UN Security Council (UNSC) to refer Russia to the court—and, as a permanent member of the council, Russia could veto any such move. Russia does recognise the International Court of Justice, which hears disputes between governments, but that court also enforces its rulings in the UNSC.One response is to send Ukraine more arms and impose more sanctions on Russia. America will ban new investment there. The European Union has proposed blocking its ships and lorries and banning imports of coal. The EU should do more, and limit purchases of oil and gas, too.The other response is for the courts to press on with their investigations. Russian forces have a duty to protect Ukrainians, but they are treating them as if they are tools of war. Because the West, like Ukraine, rejects the Russian view that people are a means to an end, it should back the courts’ efforts to show that every life matters. The legal process will also shed light on Russia’s lies, to the shame of Mr Putin’s international backers. Even now the Kremlin has said the atrocities were faked, then used the UN to blame the Ukrainians and accuse them of being Nazis. And should those who wish Mr Putin’s regime to fall be satisfied, indictments may help ensure that war criminals lose power with him. Who knows, they may even end up in a jail cell. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline ""To indict is right""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The country needs a new political settlement that diminishes the power of extremistsPrivate credit, not buy-outs, is stealing the limelightThe greenback is still king.

39,When and how might the war in Ukraine end?,,26/05/22,"The war in Ukraine, says its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, will be won on the battlefield but can end only through negotiations. When to stop fighting, and on what terms? The West says that is for Ukraine to decide. Yet three months into the war, Western countries are staking out positions on the endgame.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.They are splitting into two broad camps, explains Ivan Krastev, of the Centre for Liberal Strategies, a think-tank in Sofia. One is the “peace party”, which wants a halt to the fighting and the start of negotiations as soon as possible. The other is the “justice party”, which thinks Russia must be made to pay dearly for its aggression.The argument turns in the first instance on territory: let Russia hold on to the land it has conquered thus far; push it back to its starting line on February 24th; or try to shove it even farther back, to the international border, to recover territories it seized in 2014? The debate revolves around much else besides, not least the costs, risks and rewards of prolonging the war; and the place of Russia in the European order.The peace camp is mobilising. Germany has called for a ceasefire; Italy is circulating a four-track plan for a political settlement; France speaks of a future peace deal without “humiliation” for Russia. Ranged against them stand mainly Poland and the Baltic states, championed by Britain. What of America? Ukraine’s most important backer has yet to set out a clear objective, beyond strengthening Ukraine to give it a stronger bargaining hand. America has spent nearly $14bn on the war so far, and Congress has just allocated a further $40bn. America has rallied military donations from more than 40 other countries. But this help is not unlimited. It has delivered artillery, but not the longer-range rocket systems that Ukraine is asking for. Remarks by Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, add to the ambiguity. After visiting Kyiv last month he embraced the justice party, saying the West should help Ukraine “win” and “weaken” Russia. Three weeks later he seemed to tack to the peace camp, calling for an “immediate ceasefire” following a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu. The Pentagon insists there is no change of policy.Another blow to the justice party was an editorial in the New York Times arguing that the defeat of Russia was unrealistic and dangerous. Then Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state, said negotiations should start within two months to avoid “upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome”. There would ideally be a return to the line of February 24th; “pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,” he declared at the World Economic Forum, a talkfest in Davos. Russia, he said, had an important role to play in Europe’s balance of power; it should not be pushed into a “permanent alliance” with China.For now, such cracks in the West are contained by the mantra that the future is for Ukrainians to decide. Yet Ukraine’s choices are in turn shaped by what the West will provide. “Europe, the world at large, should be united. We are as strong as you are united,” Mr Zelensky told a meeting at Davos. He said that “Ukraine will be fighting until it gains all its territory back.” But he also seemed to leave himself space for compromise. Talks with Russia, he said, could begin once it withdraws to the line of February 24th.America, Europe and Ukraine have to keep adjusting their positions according to what each thinks the other will accept. “The Ukrainians are negotiating with their Western partners as much as, and probably more than, they’re negotiating with the Russians,” says Olga Oliker of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. The fuzziness also reflects the uncertainties of war. Is Ukraine winning, because it saved Kyiv and pushed Russia back from Kharkiv; or is it losing, because Russia has taken Mariupol and may soon encircle Severodonetsk? The peace party worries that the longer the fighting goes on, the greater the human and economic cost to Ukraine and the rest of the world. The justice camp retorts that sanctions on Russia are just starting to bite; with more time and more and better weapons Ukraine can win. Behind all this lie two contradictory worries. One is that Russian forces are still strong and will prevail in a grinding war. The other is that they are brittle. If routed, Russia could lash out at nato, or resort to chemical or even nuclear weapons to avoid defeat. In the long term, says Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Europe will need to find a way of living with Russia. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, retorts, “It is much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him.” American and European officials have quietly been helping Ukraine develop negotiating positions. One point is its demand for security guarantees from the West. Short of a promise to defend Ukraine directly, ideas include the ability to “snap back” any sanctions on Russia that are lifted; and rearming Ukraine quickly if it is attacked again.Right now, Ukraine is reasonably optimistic. It has denied Russia an easy conquest, and new Western weapons are appearing on the front lines. But speaking from the sandbagged presidential headquarters, Mykhailo Podolyak, Mr Zelensky’s chief negotiator, says he is increasingly concerned by the “fatigue” in some European countries. “They don’t say it directly, but it feels like an attempt to force us to capitulate. Any ceasefire means a frozen conflict.” He also complained of “inertia” in Washington: weapons are not arriving in the quantities Ukraine needs.When the war ends will depend in large part on Russia. It is in no hurry for a ceasefire. It seems determined to conquer all of the Donbas in the east, and talks of taking more land in the west. “The paradox of the situation is that both sides still believe they can win,” says Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst in Kyiv. “Only if we really reach a stalemate, and Moscow and Kyiv recognise it as such, can any talk of compromise be possible. Even then, it is likely to be temporary.” ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""When and how might the fighting end?""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
40,Edging closer to war,,01/03/14,"By A.O. | BALACLAVA AND SIMFEROPOLRUSSIA and Ukraine have edged closer to a military confrontation after Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, asked the upper house of the Russian parliament to approve the deployment of the country's armed forces in Ukraine. The request was made “in connection with the extraordinary situation developing in Ukraine and the danger to the lives of the citizens of Russian Federation and our compatriots and military personnel located within the territory”.An official in Ukraine’s armed forces says that after several days without the use of force, military units across Ukraine have been put on heightened alert and told to open fire if they come under attack. A week ago Russian and Ukrainian military commanders informally agreed among themselves to avoid confrontation and provocations. But in the past two days several Ukrainian military units have come under attack from unidentified armed men, who are widely believed to be Russian forces. A Ukrainian military airport in Kirovsky was attacked on February 28th by some 350 men in camouflage, who smashed up navigation systems, rendering the airport unusable. Feodosiya, Ukraine’s naval base in the Black Sea, was approached by Zubr, Russian-made air-cushioned hovercraft, which retreated after the Ukrainian navy threatened resistance.At the entrance to Balaclava bay on March 1st were ten military personnel trucks with Russian number plates, alongside five armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns, blocking Ukrainian customs posts. Each truck held some 30 masked men with automatic rifles, who did not respond to questions. Two military ambulances were parked next to them, and two Russian Orthodox priests stood holding a large cross. A small crowd of perhaps two-dozen local people waved Russian flags.Meanwhile, the causeway between Crimea and mainland Ukraine has been blocked. On a main road between the cities of Simferopol and Sebastopol, a checkpoint manned by an unarmed ""self defence"" unit and leather-clad pro-Russia bikers displays a sign reading: ""Where we are—is Russia"". The bikers have put up a black banner with red lettering saying: ""Russia has always been a graveyard for evil ideas. You cannot win over a graveyard, you can only stay in it—for ever.""It is understood that Russia has sent its elite units to Crimea, and that it now has between 6,000 and 7,000 men on the peninsula in addition to those already stationed in Russian bases there. The movement of troops started on February 23rd, the day of the closing ceremony of the Sochi Olympics. “This feels like 22nd June 1941,” the Ukrainian official said, referring to the day when Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union.Ukraine's armed forces are much less well-equipped than the Russian army. The total number of Ukrainian military personnel in Crimea is estimated at about 14,000. But only a few thousands of those troops are ready for combat. The forces have lacked a clear chain of command since the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, who on February 28th gave a press conference in Russia in which he insisted that he was still Ukraine's president. Ukraine's new defence minister was appointed only a couple of days ago. Russia has chosen Ukraine's moment of greatest weakness to move into Crimea.In the early hours of February 28th, well equipped and professional-looking men in camouflage uniforms with assault rifles took over two Crimean airports, set up road blocks, hemmed Ukraine’s navy into the Balaklava bay near Sevastopol and established control over the local television tower. The men displayed no insignias and did not answer questions. But by the evening armoured personnel-carriers with Russian markings were moving from Sevastopol, where Russia has a naval base, to Simferopol, in the centre of the peninsula, where several military cargo-planes were reported to be landing at a nearby Russian military base. The airspace over Crimea was closed. All this was done swiftly and silently.Alexander Turchinov, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament and the acting president, said that Russia has started an “undisguised aggression against our country…Under the cover of military exercises they [the Russians] brought their military forces into Crimea and are trying to blockade the positions of Ukrainian military forces.”Mr Turchinov said that Russia was following the same script it had used during a war with Georgia in 2008, which resulted in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two breakaway territories, being occupied by Russian forces. Then, Russia issued people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia with Russian passports, and when fighting broke out between South Ossetia and Georgia, said it needed to protect the lives of its citizens. By contrast, there has been no fighting in Crimea so far. Russia’s de facto invasion has instead prompted parallels with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.Russian television channels, which are widely watched in Crimea, provided propaganda to give cover to what increasingly looks like a well-prepared military takeover. It is happening on the 60th anniversary of Nikita Khrushchev's transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine, when both were part of the Soviet Union. Whether Russia's ultimate goal this time is to annex Crimea or simply to gain leverage over Ukraine's new government is unclear.A day earlier, on February 27th, unidentified men had taken over the parliament in Simferopol, disarming and kicking out the local police. The gunmen then let in the local deputies, took away their mobile telephones and oversaw the voting in of a new government led by Sergei Aksenov, the leader of the Russian Unity party. The parliament then called a referendum on Crimea’s autonomy. Valentina Samar, an investigative reporter in Crimea, says the vote was rigged.Mr Aksenov, nicknamed the “Goblin”, declared himself in charge of Crimea's armed forces, and told them not to respond to orders from Kiev. He has also announced that the Berkut—the quad of riot police that brutalised protestors in Kiev's Independence Square, and which was disbanded by the new government—is to be restored under his command. Russia said it had started issuing Berkut officers with Russian passports. Mr Aksenov then called on Mr Putin to provide Russian help in maintaining order in Crimea. Russia’s own parliament is due to meet next week to discuss a simplified procedure to integrate new territories.Arseny Yatseniuk, Ukraine’s prime minister, appealed to the Kremlin to “stop provoking civil and military conflict. We demand that the Russian Federation recalls its troops.” The majority of Crimea's 2m inhabitants are ethnic Russians, but some 13% are Crimean Tartars, who suffered mass killings under early Soviet rule and mass deportations under Stalin. They returned to Crimea after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and most have no desire to be brought back into Russia. “This is an unannounced and open aggression against the territory of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, which is supposed to be a guarantor of its sovereignty,” says Refat Chubarov, the leader of Crimea's Tartars. According to the Budapest agreement of 1994, which was signed by Ukraine, Russia, America and Britain, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arms in exchange for security guarantees from the co-signatories.In Simferopol, a few dozen men and women came out on the streets to protest against what they described as a neo-Nazi and NATO-sponsored government in Kiev. To keep up their spirits, an elderly lady acted as a DJ, singing along to 1930s Soviet songs that were played in the background. But as unidentified soldiers took up their positions in the streets, most of Simferopol’s 250,000 residents stayed indoors.Picture credit: AFPA big bump in voter turnout puts a competent ethnic German, Klaus Iohannis, in the presidencyPoland hoped shale gas would free it from Russia, but finds there is no getting around geologyEdgars Rinkevics enters the culture war with eastern European conservatives, and with Russia"
41,How Ukraine tamed Russian missile barrages and kept the lights on,,12/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warRUSSIA WAS already a month into its campaign to bomb Ukraine’s energy infrastructure when the man in charge of Ukraine’s power grid, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, saw a fleet of kamikaze drones headed towards his office. The attack on October 17th at Ukrenergo’s Kyiv headquarters sent many of his colleagues running for the shelters. Soldiers stayed above ground to try to shoot down the drones. Mr Kudrytsky headed off in his car to help colleagues. “Some of us have experienced five, ten, 20 attacks over this winter and at one point you cease being frightened,” he recalls. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The latest raid, in the early hours of March 9th, saw Russia target hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of missiles on critical infrastructure. It tested the tenacity of energy planners for the 15th time this winter. But with most of the country swiftly brought back on line, it did not change the fundamentals; Ukraine is still winning a battle in which few had expected it to prevail. Engineers are now repairing the system faster than it can be destroyed. Before the latest attack, Kyiv had enjoyed four consecutive weeks with no outages. The use by Russia of hard-to-replace Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles at the end of winter would appear to indicate increasing desperation in Moscow.Things were certainly touch and go at times. The initial Russian operation was clinical, targeting hundreds of high-voltage transformers, the house-size workhorses of the national power grid. No electricity meant no gas, no water, no sewage, no heating. Some predicted frozen cities and a humanitarian crisis with millions of refugees. That this did not happen is down to preparation, luck, quick thinking, and new air-defence systems that began to arrive just in time. More than 100 energy workers have lost their lives in the battle. The darkest days were in late November. When the capital’s infrastructure was hit by a barrage of 67 missiles on the 23rd, the system began to switch off automatically to protect itself. For a few hours, Kyiv was completely without electricity, says Serhiy Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, the company that supplies energy to the capital. It was not clear when the system would come back on again, or whether, indeed, the damaged grid could even support the necessary currents when it did. There was talk that the city would have to drain water from its heating system, for fear that pipes would freeze over and crack. “This was a truly frightening moment,” recalls Mr Kovalenko. “We didn’t know if it was a matter of hours, days, or even weeks. We were joyful when the grid slowly began to function again later the same day.”As the Russian campaign ground on, Ukraine became ever more adept at countering the airborne threat, and at fixing the damage on the ground. The process now resembles “a chess game with death”, says Yuriy Ihnat, a colonel in Ukraine’s Air Force Command. “The enemy tries to outwit us, and we try to outwit the enemy.” The Russians look to locate and destroy Ukrainian air defences using all the tools at their disposal: A-50 airborne early-warning aircraft, which can detect any Ukrainian missile launch; drones; satellites; and a network of spies. Ukraine responds with its own techniques: deception in the form of fake launch positions, and keeping air-defence assets as mobile as it can. At the start of the winter, Ukraine could rely only on Soviet-era systems such as S-300s and Buks. When things were bad, it managed an interception rate of just 20-30%. More recently, with the help of new mobile groups and Western air-defence systems like NASAMS, that figure is, Ukraine claims, regularly above 75%. Ukraine’s new Patriot air-defence systems are yet to come on line, so Ukraine cannot intercept high-speed missiles like the Kh-22 anti-ship missile and Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic ballistic missile. The use of such expensive and scarce missiles in the attack on March 9th explains the low interception rate of below 50%. Ukraine has been helped by ingenious engineering. Ukrenergo’s Mr Kudrytsky says his company had deliberately kept back-up stock of high-voltage equipment when refurbishing substations in the years before the war. Besides that, there were what he describes as mind-blowing engineering solutions. After drones hit one facility in November, a particularly hard-to-replace piece of hardware went up in flames. There was no obvious substitute in the storeroom. So the technical team decided to attempt what should have been an impossible repair. “In the electric world, if something is on fire at a voltage class of 330,000V or higher, you say goodbye to it,” he says. “But somehow they managed it.” Russia’s winter attacks on infrastructure rendered up to half of Ukraine’s grid unusable at one stage. But the only indisputably lasting result is that the aggressor has expended much of its reserve of kit: nearly 1,000 missiles and a similar number of drones. Western officials believe Russia is now largely limited to using whatever comes off the production line. Ukraine for its part is determined to remove as many remaining weaknesses as it can for the months and years ahead. The government has already announced novel plans to protect some of the most vulnerable parts of the grid underground, and to increase air defences above it. Mr Kudrytsky is coy about the details, but, he says, “We showed things that seemed impossible can somehow become possible…We made the impossible ordinary.” ■This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Winning the electricity war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
42,The conflict in Ukraine is settling into a war of attrition,,08/06/22,"The war in Ukraine, now in its fourth month, defies simple notions of winning and losing. Russian forces are thought to be in control of most of Severodonetsk, a city at the eastern edge of a Ukrainian salient, having beaten off Ukrainian counter-attacks. Ukrainian resistance is now confined to an industrial zone in the westernmost edge of the town. Yet territorial control is ebbing and flowing. Russia’s net gains in eastern Ukraine between the middle of April and the end of May add up to just over 450 square kilometres (about a third of the size of Greater London) according to Rochan Consulting, a firm which tracks the war; hardly a spectacular bounty. Neither Russia nor Ukraine looks likely to make a decisive breakthrough. Instead, each hopes to grind the other down in a war of attrition.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Russia’s losses have been severe. The invasion force that it initially committed to the war had been reduced to about 58% of its pre-war strength by the middle of May, according to a Western official. By June 1st that had fallen by another few percentage points. Russian battalion tactical groups, the basic fighting formations of the Russian army, probably started the war with around 600 men each; recently some have been seen with only 60, barely larger than a platoon. The damage to armour has been especially dramatic. Russia has lost at least 761 tanks, over a third of them since the beginning of the Donbas offensive on April 18th.Russian commanders are now throwing old equipment into battle. The t-62, a tank which entered service in 1961 and was spruced up in the 1980s, has been spotted in Donbas in recent weeks, some models adorned with improvised “cage armour” bolted on top to provide rudimentary, and probably ineffective, protection against anti-tank munitions. Tom Bullock of Janes, a defence intelligence company, says that such redundant kit is probably destined for the Donetsk People’s Militia, a Russian proxy force, allowing them to hold a defensive line and freeing up the Russian army for more important tasks.Much less is known about the state of Ukraine’s forces. Western officials are saying nothing that might undermine Ukrainian morale, and there is less open-source evidence, such as imagery on social media, showing its losses. What is clear, though, is that Ukraine has also taken a mauling. On May 31st Volodymyr Zelensky, the country’s president, said that 60 to 100 of his soldiers were dying each day, with 500 more being wounded—loss rates comparable to some battles of the second world war. Western officials say those figures are broadly accurate. One says that Russian and Ukrainian loss rates are now about the same. The morgue in Bakhmut, an immediate destination for Ukrainian soldiers killed in fighting to the east, was reported to be overflowing this week, with bodies left outside on the street.If the war is settling into a contest of attrition, which side is more likely to prevail? A great deal depends on which country can produce a steadier flow of manpower, equipment and ammunition. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has so far refused to conduct a nationwide mobilisation of reservists and conscripts, but there is evidence that the country’s defence ministry is trying to lure men with military experience back into action with the promise of pay packets as hefty as $5,000 per month—six to eight times the salary of an average lieutenant.Ukraine’s problem is different. It has an ample source of motivated recruits, but insufficient people to train them. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, says that the number of would-be recruits for the armed forces is so high that there is a waiting list of over a month to be inducted. That suggests that in the short term it will be very difficult to build the six new brigades—25,000 men—that a Ukrainian official recently told the Financial Times would be necessary for a major counter-offensive to take back land in the east and south.On the face of it, equipment should be less of a problem. America, Australia and European countries have all sent more artillery, ammunition and other arms to Ukraine over the past month. America, Britain and Germany have also promised rocket launchers that can strike around three times farther than those artillery systems. These probably will not come quickly enough to halt Russia’s conquest of Severodonetsk and possibly nearby towns, such as Lysychansk, which Mr Zelensky visited in person on June 5th. The Pentagon says that it will take weeks to train Ukrainian forces on the himars rocket launcher.But if the war drags on for months or even years, as American and European officials now expect, these foreign weapons will play a vital role. Ukraine is either out of some types of Soviet-standard ammunition or close to it, says Michael Kofman of cna, a think-tank. The stocks of such ammunition in former Warsaw Pact states, like Poland, will also run dry in time. If Ukraine’s army can switch to nato-standard arms, it would allow Western countries to underwrite a much longer campaign. “Even though the local military balance in… Donbas appears favourable to Russia, the overall trends in the military balance still favour Ukraine,” argues Mr Kofman—if, that is, Western support is sustained.Many European countries are also running low on some of the weapons being sent to Ukraine, such as anti-tank missiles; and it could take years to ramp up production. Nor is it straightforward for Ukraine to absorb the new weaponry. Though Western defence officials have been impressed by the speed with which Ukrainian troops have got to grips with the new kit, maintaining dozens of new and unfamiliar systems in wartime conditions is not easy. The Economist understands that many artillery pieces have already had to be sent back to Poland for repair. Russia still has the advantage in guns.The Biden administration believes that the $40bn package of assistance signed by the president on May 21st will allow a “high tempo” of military aid to continue until nearly the end of the year. In practice, both sides will need to pause fighting, to rest and rebuild their battered armies long before then. Yet the fighting is then likely to resume. Mr Putin has a cynical view of Western staying power. He believes that European and transatlantic divisions will widen as the war drags on. Higher energy prices, inflation and wider economic disruption might encourage those who want an early ceasefire. “We cannot make that mistake again,” argued Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s prime minister, on June 6th, citing Russia’s land grab in Georgia in 2008 as well as the Minsk deals negotiated by France and Germany after Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “We have to be prepared for a long war.”■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Grinding on""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
43,How Russia’s war could revive America’s uranium industry,,23/06/22,"Edward abbey, an author, national-park ranger and relentless curmudgeon, once described south-eastern Utah as the “most arid, most hostile, most lonesome…quarter of the state”, and “the best part by far.” Abbey’s favourite bit of Utah is home to red sandstone canyons, sacred tribal lands, all manner of desert critters—and America’s only operating uranium mill. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Uranium prospecting surged during the cold war as America built its nuclear arsenal. Low-enriched uranium fuels most nuclear reactors; very highly enriched uranium is used in bombs. Most mining took place on the Colorado Plateau, an area spanning swathes of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. At the industry’s peak in 1980 it produced nearly 43.7m pounds (19.8m kg) of the stuff. Then things went downhill. American firms couldn’t compete with cheap uranium imports from Canada and Australia, and, later, from former Soviet states. American companies produced just 21,000 pounds of uranium last year (see chart). Yet the White Mesa mill in southern Utah is still converting uranium ore into yellowcake, a condensed powder. For decades the facility has seemed a relic of the region’s boom times. But two things have conspired to breathe new life into America’s uranium industry. First, climate concern has begun to change the politics around nuclear power, which does not emit carbon. Roughly 20% of the power produced by American utilities comes from nuclear, making it the country’s largest source of clean energy. To speed decarbonisation, the Biden administration wants to prop up America’s existing nuclear plants and incentivise the development of new advanced reactors. Proponents of nuclear power argue that its steady, baseload power will be needed to keep the lights on when the sun doesn’t shine or wind doesn’t blow. There are signs that this argument is catching on. California is considering delaying the closure of its last nuclear plant, which is the state’s largest single source of electricity. Second, Russia’s war in Ukraine has many countries squirming over their reliance on Russian energy. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency, 14% of America’s uranium imports in 2021 came from Russia (and a further 43% from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan). Russia is the only commercial supplier of the type of uranium needed to fuel new reactor designs, which aim to reduce costs and safety concerns. John Barrasso, a Republican senator for Wyoming who has long wanted to prop up his state’s uranium industry (see map), has introduced a bill that would ban imports of Russian uranium. “We stopped oil, gas and coal,” says Mr Barrasso. “There’s no reason that we continue to import uranium when we have such an abundance in the United States.” That feeling is bipartisan. Jennifer Granholm, Joe Biden’s energy secretary, says the Department of Energy (doe) is developing a national “uranium strategy”. TerraPower, a firm co-founded by Bill Gates, initially planned to buy Russian uranium to power the reactor it is building in Wyoming. But even without a ban, it says it is no longer interested in Russian supplies. The politics of disavowing Russian uranium may look good on paper, but they could leave utilities and innovators like TerraPower in the lurch. Andrew Griffith, who works on nuclear-fuel supply chains at the doe, likens the nuclear industry’s woes to a chicken-and-egg dilemma. “The advanced reactors are going to have a hard time attracting investment when there’s no fuel supply,” he says, “and it’s hard to attract investment in the fuel supply if there are no customers to purchase the fuel.” To jump-start things, the doe is scrambling to ramp up mining and enrichment, in three ways. First, the department is powering up a small enrichment facility in Ohio, to demonstrate the technology. Second, some weapons-grade uranium can be “downblended” to create the lower-enriched stuff needed for reactors. Third, the department wants to incentivise the private sector, which is pushing for the creation of a Strategic Uranium Reserve similar to the petroleum stockpiles kept in underground caverns along the Gulf Coast. America’s uranium firms are salivating over the potential revival of their industry. Uranium sales are negotiated through long-term contracts rather than in an open market, given the element’s use in nuclear weapons. So it is hard to get a pure price signal, says Ian Lange, an economist at the Colorado School of Mines. Cameco, a uranium producer, estimates that the price per pound was about $48 in May. Scott Melbye, the president of Uranium Producers of America, a trade group, says that is nearly the level firms would need in order to justify restarting long-dormant mines. Tricky economics is not the only problem America’s uranium industry faces. In many western communities uranium mining is unpopular at best, and considered criminal at worst. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are more than 500 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation lands alone. The Ute Mountain Ute tribe in White Mesa worries that the mill may be affecting their water and air quality. Development of a dormant mine about ten miles south of the Grand Canyon is vehemently opposed by environmentalists and tribes in Arizona. The opposition to a uranium boom resembles the environmental-justice concerns that have doomed existing nuclear power plants. Mr Barrasso says shunning nuclear power in favour of a grid dominated by renewables would be foolish. You can’t “power the world on the sun, the wind and wishful thinking”, he says wryly. But the nuclear industry’s utter dependence on government aid requires its boosters to engage in some wishful thinking of their own. ■For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America, sign up to Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter.

44,The inflationary consequences of Russia’s war will spread,,19/03/22,"LAST SUMMER, amid mounting alarm about inflation in America, economic advisers in the White House penned a blog post in which they examined historical parallels. Although the press was full of comparisons with oil shocks in the 1970s, they wrote that a nearer relative was the dislocation after the second world war, when supply shortages interacted with pent-up demand. It was a well-reasoned argument. But the surge in commodity prices over the past month, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gives rise to an unsettling question: is the global economy now seeing a 1970s-style price shock on top of a late-1940s-style supply crunch?Your browser does not support the <audio> element.To be sure, no serious economist expects inflation in the rich world to reach the giddy double-digit heights of those episodes. On March 16th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, kicking off a tightening cycle that it expects to continue well into next year. Moreover, the retreat in oil markets in recent days could offer relief.Nevertheless, surging prices for everything from wheat to nickel threaten to add to inflation. And rolling lockdowns in parts of China could exacerbate strains on global supply chains. Consumer-price inflation in America already stood at a 40-year high in February, at 7.9% year on year; the rate in the euro area, meanwhile, exceeded 5%.Investors are still far from persuaded that central bankers are on top of the problem. The most striking evidence is the inflation expectations that can be found in fixed-income markets in America. ICE, a financial firm, distils a few different numbers, including yields on inflation-protected bonds and interest-rate swaps, into short-term and long-term indices for gauging expectations. In late January the expected rate of inflation over the next year was 3.5%. On March 15th it stood at 5.4%. Expectations in the euro area have seen similar, if slightly steeper, trends. The one-year inflation swap rate rose to 5.9% on March 8th (see chart 2).Markets are inherently volatile, so deriving inflation predictions from bond yields should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the shift in prices is broadly in line with what economists are forecasting. Last week Bank of America raised its inflation forecasts for much of the world. In America it now expects inflation over 2022 as a whole to average 7%, up from its prior forecast of 6.3%. In the euro zone it sees an even bigger increase, with inflation averaging 6% this year, well above its previous forecast of 4.4%. The challenge is greater for Europe because of its high dependency on Russia, which supplies about 45% of its gas imports.In an indication of just how pervasive the pressures are likely to be, economists are even ratcheting up their inflation forecasts for Japan, where deflation has long been the bigger threat. On March 8th S&P, a rating agency, said that Japanese inflation would average 2% this year, more than double its previous prediction. So far forecasters expect a relatively modest increase in overall inflation in emerging markets. But rising food costs will be especially damaging for their poorest citizens.Two related questions emerge from these forecasts. The first is whether the rise in commodity prices today will feed through into lofty inflation in the longer run. There is, in fact, reason for cautious optimism. A large body of research shows that the pass-through from higher oil prices into non-energy inflation is quite limited. For instance, Goldman Sachs, a bank, calculates that a 10% increase in crude-oil prices leads to a jump of nearly three-tenths of a percentage point in headline inflation in America, but to an increase of just about three-hundredths of a percentage point in core inflation (stripping out food and energy prices). That helps explain why market expectations of longer-term price trends remain more subdued: pricing for inflation five years from now is close to the Fed’s goal of keeping inflation to an average of 2%.The follow-up is what central bankers choose to do about rising commodity prices. The received wisdom of the past few decades is that policymakers should avoid over-tightening in the face of oil shocks. Indeed, surging energy prices can act as a drag on consumption, which is a particular concern for Europe.But with real interest rates deeply negative in both America and Europe, central banks still have a long way to go to rein in inflation, whatever happens to commodity prices. On March 10th the European Central Bank surprised markets by announcing that it would wind down its bond-buying more quickly. And according to the Fed’s projections, its quarter-point rate increase is likely to be the first of seven this year. Central banks are, for now, sticking to their pre-war plans. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""A Russian phenomenon""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Regulators arrange a deal for the California-based lenderThat is the popular narrative.

45,"Russia’s economy can withstand a long war, but not a more intense one",,23/04/23,"A WEEK AFTER Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, crowed, “The value of the ruble has plummeted; the Russian stockmarket closed as fear of capital flight rose; interest rates more than doubled; Russia’s credit rating has been cut to junk status.” American authorities clearly hoped that the “massive, unprecedented consequences” they and their allies had imposed on Russia, including “severe and lasting economic costs”, would help impede its war machine. Yet over the following year, despite the repeated tightening of Western sanctions, Russia’s economy recovered its poise. The IMF expects it to grow by 0.7% this year—on a par with France, and even as the British and German economies shrink. The hope that the state of Russia’s economy will provide any sort of constraint on the war has faded.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Such despair, however, is as misguided as Mr Blinken’s initial euphoria. By the admission of none other than Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, “The illegitimate restrictions imposed on the Russian economy in the medium term may indeed have a negative impact on it.” The question is not so much whether Russia can endure an even longer war of attrition (it can), but whether it can support the sort of intensification of the conflict Russia will probably need to transform its prospects on the battlefield. That looks almost impossible.Russia’s bureaucracy has achieved three feats over the past 14 months. It has found ways to withstand the fusillade of sanctions that Mr Blinken heralded. It has supplied enough men and materiel to propel Russia’s invasion. And all this has been done without a sharp decline in living standards, which might prompt popular unrest. But any attempt to escalate the conflict would inevitably undo these successes.Russia is having to cope with the broadest array of sanctions ever imposed on a big country, including on individuals associated with the war, on financial transactions involving Russian entities, on exports of certain goods to Russia and on imports of most goods from Russia. Yet this economic assault has yielded disappointing results, in part because there were always big holes in the sanctions regime and in part because Russia has found ways around some of the restrictions that did initially hem it in.Some of the showiest measures have targeted oligarchs and other cronies of Mr Putin’s regime. World-Check, a data firm, reckons that 2,215 individuals with close ties to the government can no longer travel to some or all Western countries, or gain access to their possessions there, or both. Some wealthy Russians have complained about their lost social standing. A few have left Russia and renounced their citizenship. Despite the reports of impounded superyachts, however, most oligarchs are still putting caviar on the table. Foreign governments have frozen about $100bn-worth of private Russian assets—only about a quarter of the $400bn that Russian households have abroad. The biggest imposition on many rich Russians relates to their holidays. The French Riviera is off limits; Dubai and Antalya are the main substitutes. Sanctions, perversely, may pave the way for the creation of a new generation of oligarchs. With Western firms leaving the country en masse, there are hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of assets up for grabs. If the intention behind the measures was to cause discomfort among Mr Putin’s inner circle, there is little sign of it. Financial sanctions, too, have had a limited effect. After Russia invaded Ukraine, ten Russian lenders were kicked out of SWIFT, which more than 11,000 banks around the world use for cross-border payments. Close to two-thirds of Russia’s banking system can no longer process transactions in euros or dollars. But Western countries have not cut off Russian banks entirely, as they need to pay for the Russian oil and gas they continue to import. Gazprombank, which processes these payments, remains a member of SWIFT. What is more, new financial pipes are being built to replace Western ones. Average daily transactions using CIPS, China’s alternative to SWIFT, have increased by 50% since the invasion began. This past December 16% of Russia’s exports were paid for in yuan, up from almost none before the war. The narrow gap between the price at which Russian banks sell their customers yuan and the price at which they buy yuan suggests a liquid market. Some international transactions are also settled, with difficulty, in Indian rupees and Emirati dirhams. Restrictions on exports of certain goods to Russia have also disappointed. America and its allies have banned sales to Russia of thousands of high-tech items, while many Western firms that used to operate in Russia have voluntarily pulled out. Of about 3,000 global firms with a Russian presence tracked by the KSE Institute at the Kyiv School of Economics, roughly half have curtailed operations there in some way. Last year the stock of foreign direct investment in Russia fell by a quarter.Yet Russia continues to import almost as much as it did before the invasion. New trading partners have sprung up to replace the West. China now sells twice as much to Russia as it did in 2019. “Parallel” imports—unauthorised sales from the West to Russia via a third country of everything from fizzy drinks to computer chips—have soared. In 2022 imports from the EU to Armenia mysteriously doubled, even as Armenian exports to Russia tripled. Serbia’s exports of phones to Russia rose from $8,518 in 2021 to $37m in 2022. Shipments of washing machines from Kazakhstan to Russia rose from zero in 2021 to nearly 100,000 units last year. These arrangements have drawbacks. Russia’s economic hubs are nearer to Brussels than to Beijing. Higher transport costs mean higher prices. People also have less choice than before (one Muscovite complains about the difficulty of finding mortadella). According to a recent survey by Romir, a Russian market-research firm, two-thirds of Russians reckon the quality of the products they buy is deteriorating.What is more, not all goods can be obtained in sufficient quantities through backchannels. Many Russian-made medications, which depend on imported raw materials, are in short supply. The car industry, meanwhile, is struggling with a shortage of imported semiconductors. Production was down 70% in January-February, compared with the same period a year before. Yet even if Russia cannot make as many cars any more, it can still import them. After Lada, a Soviet stalwart, the most popular brand in Russia is now Haval, a mid-range Chinese marque. Its monthly sales have increased 331% over the past year.Russia also seems to be getting hold of the parts it needs to keep its civilian planes airborne, somehow. Hackers have been stealing updates of aircraft software that Russian firms can no longer buy. Crashes, although frequent by Western standards, have not increased. The impact of sanctions on Russia’s exports has been bigger–but Western countries always shied away from making them too severe for fear of pushing up energy prices for their own consumers to unbearable levels. The EU’s imports of Russian gas have fallen dramatically. Russia has limited capacity to divert the exports to China, since the pipeline linking the two countries is small. Shipping more by sea requires new liquefaction plants which take time to build and need sophisticated tech. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, forecasts that Russia’s gas sales will dwindle to 136bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2023 from 241bcm in 2021.Oil, however, is more fungible. In December the EU, which in 2021 bought more than 40% of Russia’s crude exports, imposed an import ban. It also forbade its shipping firms, insurers and financiers from facilitating the sale of Russian crude to buyers in other countries unless the price per barrel was below $60. In February a similar package of sanctions came into force on Russia’s refined oil, a smaller but profitable export, much of which also went to Europe before the war. But Asian buyers have been happy to absorb the oil that Europe is spurning. In March nearly 90% of Russia’s total crude exports went to China and India, estimates Reid I’Anson of Kpler, a data firm, up from a quarter before the war. That month Russia shipped 3.7m barrels a day (b/d) on average, more than it did in 2021. March was also a strong month for sales of refined products such as diesel. A new ecosystem of shadow traders and shippers, largely based in Hong Kong and Dubai, has emerged to help ferry the embargoed barrels to their new destinations, often with the help of Russian lenders and insurers. These new buyers, plus high commodity prices brought about in part by the war, helped push Russia’s current-account surplus to a record $227bn—10% of GDP.But it is unlikely to see another bumper year. The price of a barrel of Brent, an oil benchmark, has fallen below $85 from an average of $100 in 2022 (see chart 1). Urals, Russia’s main grade, now sells at a steep discount at Russian ports—below $50 on average in January and February, according to the ministry of finance, compared with $76 on average in 2022. Russia would need a price of well over $100 a barrel to balance its budget, analysts estimate. The International Energy Agency, a watchdog, reckons Russia’s oil revenues were 43% lower in March than a year earlier. Economists expect the country’s current-account surplus to fall to 3-4% of GDP this year, in line with the average of the 2010s. Lower hydrocarbon sales mean lower government revenues. In 2022 the Russian government ran a deficit of about 3trn roubles ($37bn), or 2% of GDP. This year it is planning something similar, but actual spending and taxation data so far this year make that look optimistic. A deficit in the range of at least 10trn roubles, as much as 5% of GDP, looks likelier—high by Russian standards.All the same, the Russian state has plenty of options to fund itself. Russia’s sovereign-wealth fund still has about $150bn (about 10% of GDP), even after being drained of about $30bn last year. The government could also issue more debt. Last year’s bumper exports have left big Russian energy firms with lots of cash they must stash somewhere. Those firms, which are largely state-owned anyway, could also be hit with a windfall tax, as they were last year. And Russian financial institutions hold sufficient assets to cover 10trn-rouble deficits for 25 years–a huge resource the government might seek to tap in some way. Richard Connolly, an expert on the Russian economy at RUSI, a think-tank, says, “The government can always fund itself by taking money from big companies.”Money, in other words, will not be a severe constraint on the war effort. Demands on the budget for this purpose are in any case modest. Our best guess, based on comparing actual spending figures with what was budgeted before the war, is that Russia’s assault on Ukraine is currently costing it about 5trn roubles a year, or 3% of GDP–less than America spent on the Korean war. But replacing damaged weapons and spent munitions is not simply a question of money. Russia has churned through military equipment on a vast scale. Estimates of the number of armoured vehicles destroyed during the war, for example, range between 8,000 and 16,000, according to a recent report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think-tank. Russia has also lost lots of aircraft, drones and artillery systems. One solution is to fall back on existing stocks, although many of these are old and in poor repair. Another is to redirect weapons intended for export to the front line. Siemon Wezeman of SIPRI, a Swedish think-tank, reckons Russia’s arms exports plummeted from $50bn in 2021 to $11bn or less last year. He points out that unusual T-90 tanks—perhaps demonstration models, or units originally destined for Algeria—have been spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine.Russia is also trying to make more weapons. Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, recently said the country would produce 1,500 modern tanks in 2023. Officials have also said they want drones to be manufactured en masse in Russia. Some factories are working around the clock. The government is lending lavishly to arms manufacturers, or ordering banks to do so. In January and February production of “finished metal goods” was 20% higher than the year before, according to official statistics. The problem is that, to manufacture advanced weapons, it needs access to Western-made, high-end “dual-use” components, from engines to microchips, that are hard to obtain because of Western sanctions. Desperately needed parts can always be diverted to their most urgent use. Thus in February the government temporarily stopped accepting applications for biometric passports to save microchips. High-end washing machines are also being imported in large numbers to be stripped of their chips, presumably for use in guided missiles and other military kit. Ukraine’s military intelligence recently reported that every month Russia manages to make around 30 Kh-101s and 20 Kalibrs, its two main types of guided missile, presumably thanks to such ruses.But the volumes of advanced weaponry produced is nowhere near what Russia needs to replace its depleting stocks. Ukrainian and Western military officials believe that Russia has used most of its stocks of its most accurate guided missiles. Serial numbers found in the wreckage of spent missiles suggest it is now using new ones, made during the war. Insiders say the army is asking for ten times more tanks than Russia’s factories can produce. A lack of software and technical equipment also seems to be preventing Russia’s production of drones from taking off. What Russia lacks in quality, however, it may partly compensate for in quantity—by gussying up Soviet-era weapons. It is modernising perhaps 90 old tanks a month by equipping them with new electronics and communication systems. It is refurbishing old missiles that are less accurate but difficult to intercept and repurposing nuclear delivery systems to launch them. It is cannibalising civilian planes to repair fighter jets.Russia is also getting military supplies from allies. Some artillery shells appear to be arriving from China, via Belarus. Russia is also buying (ostensibly civilian) drones from its eastern neighbour, as well as artillery shells from North Korea. It reportedly also traded 60 Su-35 aircraft with Iran in exchange for several thousand kamikaze drones. In short, the quality of Russian weapons is declining, but it has found ways to avoid running out. Finding enough people to keep the war effort going is another challenge. Many have been killed in action; many more have emigrated. In the year to December 2022 the number of employed Russians under the age of 35 fell by 1.3m, according to FinExpertiza, an auditor. Shortages of workers are common. In December the central bank said that half of firms surveyed were struggling to find enough staff. There are 2.5 vacancies for every unemployed person, making the Russian labour market twice as tight as America’s. Wages are growing fast. Specialists, such as IT engineers and lawyers, are especially scarce. At a recent meeting of Russia’s entrepreneurs union, the labour shortage was the main topic of conversation. The labour shortage makes life difficult for military recruiters, too. The army is now sending conscription and mobilisation notices by email, in addition to physical copies, to make it harder for people to pretend they have not seen them. Draftees are not allowed to leave the country. With enough coercion, though, Russia should have no trouble filling its ranks. The country is not about to run out of young men: before the war there were about 17m of them. But more people on the frontline means fewer people in offices and factories. And the more widespread conscription becomes in big cities like Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the greater the chance of popular unrest. The government’s third economic achievement has been to maintain living standards. Last year it spent an extra 3% of GDP to stimulate the economy. Aside from higher spending on the military, support is coming in the form of economic aid to civilian companies: direct handouts to firms, subsidised loans, joint investments and so on. Spending on the budget category that subsumes many of these items, “national economy”, rose by 20% in 2022, to 4.3trn roubles. Between January and mid-March it increased by another 45% compared with the same period last year. Banks are being asked to give indebted firms breathing room. In 2022 business failures fell to a seven-year low.Last year “social” spending also rose, from 6trn to 7trn roubles (4.5% of GDP). However, says Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy, the federal government accounts for only part of overall social spending. The pension fund—a nominally independent agency recently renamed the Social Fund—is also doling out cash to retirees, mothers, the disabled and more, as are regional governments. Allowances towards constituencies important to Mr Putin, such as families with more than one child, the poor and the elderly, are growing, notes Maria Snegovaya of CSIS. Outside Moscow, payments to the families of dead conscripts can be enough to buy a flat. All this may explain why the war has not affected Russian living standards all that much. Consumer prices did rise by 12% last year, in large part because of a depreciation of the rouble in the spring. Average pay at medium-sized and large companies, which include many state-owned entities, rose marginally last year even after accounting for inflation. The value of people’s savings has fallen only slightly, central-bank statistics suggest. Inflation fell back to 3.5% in March.Overall, the Russian economy has proved resilient. Real GDP fell by only 2-3% last year—far less than the 10-15% decline that many economists had predicted. A “current activity indicator” compiled by Goldman Sachs, a bank, which correlated closely with official GDP numbers before the war, shows that Russia emerged from recession about a year ago. Most forecasters believe the economy will grow this year (see chart 2). All this suggests that Mr Putin should be able to maintain the war effort for some time to come. Expanding it, however, is another matter. Some on the right are calling for Mr Putin to spend more than a few percentage points of GDP on the invasion. After all, Russia has embraced total war before—including in 1942 and 1943, when it spent an astonishing 60% of its GDP on the military, according to “Accounting for War”, a book by Mark Harrison published in 1996. But it is hard to see how Mr Putin could do that while maintaining economic stability and preserving living standards. The first problem would be raising money fast. Not all the sovereign-wealth fund’s assets are liquid. Printing money would spur inflation, causing the rouble to lose value and eroding the living standards the government has worked so hard to preserve. Loading up banks with huge amounts of public debt overnight might have a similar effect, stirring doubts about how soundly the economy was being managed. Tax rises or a big shift in public expenditure towards defence would also eat into personal incomes. And any of these measures would undermine the air of calm, control and stability that Mr Putin is at pains to maintain. “Of course, national defence is the top priority,” he said recently, “but in resolving strategic tasks in this area, we should not repeat the mistakes of the past and should not destroy our own economy.”It’s unclear that spending vastly more money would achieve the desired results anyway. Russia’s economy has become more centralised, but it is not the planned, command-and-control apparatus of the Soviet times. Converting a budgetary bazooka into weapons of a more conventional sort would thus, at best, take time. The effort would exacerbate the bottlenecks that are already constricting Russia’s military output, in machinery subject to sanctions, for example, and in skilled workers. Much would depend on the continued assistance of China, the Gulf states and other countries through which Russian capital and imports flow–and they might be nervous about abetting a big Russian escalation. Throwing the kitchen sink at Ukraine therefore looks out of the question. “Considering Russia’s existing capabilities and limitations, it will likely opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign in Ukraine,” asserts the CSIS report. Mr Putin has succeeded in insulating the Russian economy from the worst effects of war and sanctions–but in a way that makes the war hard to win. ■This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""Military-industrial complexity""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents But the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understoodAnd China could retaliate in kind"
46,Has Vladimir Putin committed war crimes in Ukraine?,,01/03/22,"Editor’s note (updated April 4th 2022): As Russian soldiers withdrew from positions near to Kyiv, they left behind evidence of summary executions and random murders on a terrible scale. On April 3rd Irina Venediktova, the Ukrainian prosecutor-general, said that the bodies of 410 civilians had so far been found around the capital. Nobody doubts that the final toll will be much higher.ON MARCH 23rd, America’s State Department accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine. A week earlier President Joe Biden had told a reporter that he considered Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, a “war criminal”. Other leaders have not gone as far as Mr Biden, but on March 2nd 39 governments had asked the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The speed of the action and the large number of countries involved in the appeal—a record in an ICC case—showed the seriousness with which the world is taking charges of war crimes against Vladimir Putin’s regime. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, who is responsible for conducting court investigations, had said he planned to begin one (subject to the approval he has now got) only two days before and can now work “as rapidly as possible”. Usually, the wheels of international justice grind much more slowly than this.Russia does not recognise the authority of the ICC. But the court, Mr Khan argues, has jurisdiction over war crimes committed on Ukrainian soil because the government of Ukraine had twice accepted its mandate, once in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and again in 2015, when it recognised the court’s jurisdiction for “an indefinite duration”. Mr Khan’s predecessor had also conducted her own preliminary investigation in 2020 into earlier Russian actions. So what are the chances of bringing Mr Putin or his military officers to international justice? There is no serious doubt that Russia has broken international law in Ukraine. The ICC came into force in 2002 to prosecute four main crimes: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression. There is prima facie evidence that Russia has committed at least three of those. Under the ICC statutes, war crimes include wilful killing, wilfully causing great suffering and the destruction and appropriation of property. These are “grave breaches” of the Geneva Conventions which Russia has signed and which define international legal obligations not just in wars but in military actions where war has not been formally declared (as in Ukraine). These “grave breaches” provide the legal definition of war crimes under the Conventions. Crimes of aggression, according to the ICC, include invasion, military occupation, the annexation of land, bombardment, and the blockade of ports. And the ICC defines crimes against humanity as participation in and knowledge of “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”.Moreover the ubiquitous mobile phones of Ukraine are capturing instances of violence that might meet the criteria on camera. Analysts have videos of cluster bombs in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, and even an attack on a kindergarten in Okhtyrka, a city 70 miles (110km) to the north-west. Cluster bombs are not banned in Ukraine and Russia but they are in most countries and offer evidence of indiscriminate attacks on civilians. As Mr Khan pointed out, “directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects amounts to a war crime.”But it is one thing to find that Russia is in breach of these international laws, quite another to bring any Russian, let alone its head of state, to the world court. ICC rules say that both parties to a dispute—the aggressor as well as victim—must accept the court’s jurisdiction. Ukraine does. In 2000 Russia signed the Rome statute that set up the ICC, but it withdrew its signature in 2016 after the court classified its annexation of Crimea as an occupation. That does not rule out the prosecutor’s bringing a case or issuing arrest warrants. But it would require the Russian government to hand over indicted individuals—which the Putin regime is unlikely to do—or would require the UN Security Council to refer Russia to the court. Russia has a veto there so long as it retains its position as one of the council’s permanent five members. That, however, may not be quite the end of the matter legally. Even if the ICC’s prosecutor may not be able to try suspects, a finding that Russia had committed war crimes or crimes against humanity would deepen the country’s already profound diplomatic isolation. It might also open up other legal avenues against Mr Putin. Several European countries have so-called “universal jurisdiction” laws which allow them to bring cases against someone regardless of the perpetrator’s nationality or the place where the crimes took place. Germany, for example, has incorporated the ICC treaty into domestic law and has convicted at least three people (not German citizens) for involvement in genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. Compared with the horrors of the battlefield, contests in court may seem almost trivial. But legal jeopardy has a way of ensnaring its targets. The prospect of facing legal charges might possibly deter some of Mr Putin’s lieutenants from following orders to commit further war crimes. And if, as may yet happen, the invasion of Ukraine ultimately fails and leads to Mr Putin’s overthrow, the legal case against him will be ready.Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereMore from The Economist explains:Tracking Russia’s invasion of UkraineWhy Donetsk and Luhansk are at the heart of the Ukraine crisisIf the supply of Russian gas to Europe were cut off, could LNG plug the gap?The Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
47,Ukraine’s gay soldiers fight Russia—and for their rights,,05/04/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warWhen Pasha Lagoyda joined the Ukrainian army in 2021, he didn’t tell anyone he was gay. In his first weeks his room-mates at training camp found some “spicy texts”, as he puts it, and he was bullied. “There was aggression. They called me a faggot—all that stuff.”Your browser does not support the <audio> element.As his fellow recruits got to know him better, the intimidation died down. Now Mr Lagoyda is serving on the front line and all the 180 people in his unit know he’s gay. He posts selfies looking fit in his camo fatigues with washboard abs and immaculate stubble. He is also a member of LGBTIQMilitary, an Instagram account that features lgbt people in military service. It even has a link to buy merch: mugs and cloth patches depicting an armoured unicorn breathing fire. “Wherever I serve,” says Mr Lagoyda, “everyone tells me: ‘Because you are here at war, in principle I have no right to call you gay or a faggot; you are just a person who is protecting us on an equal footing’.” He is not alone. Thousands of gay people are serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, often sporting a rainbow badge next to the Ukrainian blue and yellow on their uniform. LGBT groups have also been at the forefront of humanitarian volunteering. Their visibility has led to a sea-change in Ukrainian society. Homosexual sex was decriminalised after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but when Kyiv’s first Gay Pride parade was held in 2013 only a few dozen people were brave enough to ignore the threat of skinhead violence. Even after Ukraine’s revolution of 2014 and the reforms that followed, legislation protecting gay rights lagged behind. Despite years of campaigning, for example, parliament has still not amended Ukraine’s hate-crime laws to include acts against gay people. War changes everything. Last summer, the parliament finally ratified the Council of Europe’s Istanbul convention on violence against women, after a decade-long delay, caused by the objections of church groups to the use of “gender” in the text. It is now drafting a bill that would give same-sex couples the right to register civil partnerships, something that was unimaginable even a year ago.Inna Sovsun, the MP who introduced the bill, says she was encouraged when a petition last summer calling for same-sex marriage to be legalised was signed by over 25,000 people, meeting the threshold for presidential consideration. Polls have shown that more than half of Ukrainians think gay and bisexual people should enjoy equal rights. Ukraine’s president, Volodymr Zelensky, has signalled support for a civil-partnership law, but his government has yet to make it a priority. Protecting the rights of gay people in the military gives a big push for the bill. Civil partnerships would let same-sex couples make medical decisions if a partner is wounded; if one is killed, the survivor would be able to bury him or her according to their wishes, inherit with the same tax advantages that marital spouses have, and receive state compensation for the loss. “It’s something many people dream about,” says Mr Lagoyda. “If something happens to me, God forbid, I want my boyfriend to be able come to the intensive care or take my body away.” Sofiia Lapina, head of Ukrainepride, an NGO, argues that the shift in attitudes on gay issues partly reflects Ukrainian aspirations to be culturally and politically closer to Europe. It is also a way, she adds, for Ukrainians to oppose Vladimir Putin’s repressive Russia, which has outlawed “homosexual propaganda” and characterises the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against the West’s supposed promotion of gay marriage, rampant paedophilia and gender-neutral pronouns.Ukrainian LGBT groups have documented how lesbian and gay people in Russian-occupied territories have been hunted down, raped, detained and humiliated. Tattoos of gay symbols are as much a red flag to Russian troops as Ukrainian tridents. Transgender people there are afraid to go out into the streets. Ms Lapina says “Ukrainians have begun to see more clearly that hate in any form—racism, homophobia—is basically Russian propaganda.” ■This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""A battle yet to be won""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
48,Mick Ryan on why Ukraine can expect to make further gains against Russia,,23/10/22,"IN EARLY SEPTEMBER Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhny, published an article that explored Russia’s war aims in Ukraine. It was a succinct assessment from the man who has led Ukraine’s defence since Russia’s invasion in February. “There is every reason to believe that [the war] is not going to end anywhere within 2022,” he wrote.Within days of the article appearing, Ukrainian troops surged out of their assembly areas in north-eastern Ukraine and broke through thinly manned Russian defensive lines. For those who have observed the Ukrainians closely the timing may have been a surprise, but the method was not. From the start of this war, the Ukrainians have surprised the Russians consistently with their competence and tactical ingenuity, attacking their weak points and forcing them constantly to downgrade their strategic ambitions.The Ukrainian military strategy might best be described as a strategy of corrosion. The Ukrainians, through indirect attacks, information operations, destruction of Russian logistics and commanders, and tough close combat, have corroded Russian soldiers’ physical, moral, and intellectual capacity to fight. In the war’s initial phase, the Ukrainians did this against the northern Russian expedition, forcing a Russian withdrawal. They are now doing the same in their north-eastern and southern offensives.There are political as well as military imperatives for the Kharkiv and Kherson offensives. Politically, Ukraine’s leaders felt both domestic and international pressure to show that they could seize back their nation. There was a sense that continued support from the West might depend on it. Some in the Ukrainian high command probably thought that while both sides were exhausted, the Russians were more thinly stretched across the country. Perhaps there were opportunities to push back the Russians further, if the right striking points could be found. By late in the northern summer, the Ukrainians had already launched a campaign to seize back the strategically decisive southern provinces. Throughout August progress had been slow, however. The Russians deployed additional reinforcements to the region. And while the Ukrainians were making progress attacking Russian logistics, commanders and important transport nodes, there was a sense among some observers that the broader war could become another Donbas-like meat grinder.That all changed last month. On September 6th, the Ukrainians penetrated deep into the Russian defensive lines east of Kharkiv. Over a six-day period, the forces led by General Oleksandr Syrsky recaptured dozens of Ukrainian settlements and forced the Russians to retreat, leaving behind massive quantities of equipment and munitions. Shortly afterwards, the Ukrainians surged across the Oskil River, and by early October had liberated thousands of square kilometres of Ukrainian territory.On October 2nd, the situation got even worse for Russia. General Andriy Kovalchuk’s forces in the south, having identified several weak points in Russian defensive lines north of Kherson, launched an offensive that quickly broke through them. The Ukrainians, like their compatriots in the north-east, advanced as far south as Dudchany in a matter of days.These Ukrainian southern and north-eastern campaigns—a one-two punch against Russia—continue to develop. There are several lessons to be drawn from them.First, the offensives are the result of a series of cleverly orchestrated activities in a unified operational design. The two campaigns are designed to mutually reinforce each other. Operational design is an important aspect in the planning and conduct of large-scale military activities. Competent operational design allows military commanders to sequence the tactical actions of forces in the field to meet strategic and political outcomes. This is a very complicated process, demanding the prioritisation of limited assets such as HIMARS rocket launchers, air support and electronic warfare. Surprise and deception are crucial.Second, eight months into this war, it is apparent that Ukraine has senior commanders who are seasoned strategists and operational planners. These leaders have the measure of their adversary. They understand how to balance strategic risk and opportunity and are clearly skilled at guiding their subordinates through the planning and execution of campaign-level military endeavours. This is an uncommon proficiency that few military institutions possess. In the Ukrainians, this is founded on their knowledge of Soviet operational theory which has been refined in pre-war NATO training and with battlefield experience. Finally, the recent Ukrainian campaigns have highlighted the asymmetry in innovation and command philosophies between the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. Ukraine has moved away from Soviet-era approaches and permits its soldiers to innovate and its military leaders the freedom to exploit opportunities. The Russians do not. And they will probably have to further centralise their control once more inexperienced conscripts arrive on the battlefield. This hierarchical rigidity has been a weakness of the Russians that the Ukrainians have consistently exploited.#The Russian Army continues to reel from Ukraine’s recent counter strokes. The well-led, highly adaptive and tactically competent Ukrainians fight with a purpose not evident in Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian military has responded in a decisive manner to those pundits who earlier questioned whether they could conduct large-scale offensives. And it is probable that the Ukrainians are carefully watching for further opportunities to exploit. We may see other Ukrainian strikes before winter sets in. The Ukrainian capacity to orchestrate varied, well-led and concurrent military campaigns across their territory, and to orchestrate a campaign for hearts and minds through online platforms and beyond, are a harbinger of other potential conflicts this century. This war is far from over, but Ukraine has developed a mastery of modern war that many others—including the Chinese—will study closely. ■_______________Mick Ryan served for more than 30 years in various roles in Australia’s army and the US Joint Staff.

49,War-crimes prosecutions in Ukraine are a long game,,30/04/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warTEREKHIVKA IS A rambling farming village outside Chernihiv, full of low iron-roofed houses and telephone poles topped with stork’s nests. The village boasts a general store and a community centre, and it used to have a kiosk selling soft drinks. The kiosk has been closed since February 24th 2022, when Russian forces invaded and occupied the area for more than a month. The Russians found a use for it, though: for several days soldiers imprisoned a civilian named Oleksandr Marusik there and tortured him, standing on his wounded leg and asking him where Ukrainian units were located. Unable to bear the pain, Mr Marusik begged them to kill him. Eventually, they let him go.Amidst the legion of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, Mr Marusik’s story seems unremarkable. Russia has bombed and shelled civilian targets in Ukrainian cities, killing thousands. Its troops have tortured, sexually abused and murdered non-combatants in towns they have occupied, such as Bucha. Russia has systematically abducted Ukrainian children. A video clip that surfaced in mid-April appeared to show Russian soldiers beheading living Ukrainian prisoners of war.Ukrainian prosecutors have opened more than 80,000 war-crimes cases since the invasion, according to Andriy Kostin, the country’s prosecutor-general. Yet Mr Marusik’s case stands out in one respect: it is one of some 30 that have already led to a conviction. On February 17th a court in Chernihiv convicted a Russian soldier named Denis Kuznetsov in absentia for torturing him. The trial shows the efforts Ukraine is making to prosecute war crimes. But it also highlights the flaws in those efforts. Ukraine lacks a strategy for building cases against senior Russian leaders, as opposed to foot soldiers. Its allies have eagerly provided databases and training, but deployed few investigators of their own. A blizzard of international aid initiatives defy co-ordination. If Ukraine and its allies hope to render judgment on the people responsible for Russia’s war crimes, they have work to do.Serhiy Khamaiko, the regional prosecutor who tried Mr Marusik’s case, says he picked it for a simple reason: he had the evidence. Ukrainian security services had mobile-phone data that placed Mr Kuznetsov, then 20, at the kiosk. Mr Marusik picked Mr Kuznetsov out of a photo lineup, having seen his face when not blindfolded, and recognised his voice on intercepted phone calls. The court sentenced the Russian to 12 years in prison under Article 438 of Ukraine’s criminal code, which deals with violation of the laws and customs of war.But the Ukrainian authorities have no idea where Mr Kuznetsov is. His court-appointed defence lawyer could not contact him. Mr Kuznetsov, if he is alive, may not know he has even been charged: prosecutors are required only to publish a notice in the official government courier. What, then, does his sentence mean? “Everybody asks me that,” sighs Mr Khamaiko. Russia may undergo a regime change someday, he argues, and the verdict gives a sense of justice to the victim.At tribunals such as those for the wars in Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia, prosecutors learned how to slowly build cases against the senior leaders who organised the violence. In Ukraine that has yet to happen, says Wayne Jordash, an international lawyer in Kyiv. Mr Jordash runs Global Rights Compliance, a legal practice that supports Ukrainian investigators and prosecutors. “There’s a focus on direct perpetrator cases, which look like ordinary crimes—the torture in the basement, the rape of the woman,” says Mr Jordash. Because the numbers are overwhelming and technical expertise scarce, prosecutors “are only just beginning to focus on how you take those cases upwards”.Some problems are rooted in law. Ukraine’s criminal code lacks the concept of command responsibility, which is used to charge senior commanders with war crimes even if they did not explicitly order each one. Also, Ukrainian prosecutors have little discretion: they are required to launch an investigation within 24 hours after being notified of a crime. That leads to a proliferation of minor cases.Prosecutors’ careers prosper when they win lots of trials, an incentive to pursue quick charges against soldiers rather than long investigations of their commanders. A number of Russian POWs have pleaded guilty only to be traded back in prisoner exchanges. Trials in absentia are risky: in 2015 the European Court of Human Rights struck down a war-crimes conviction in Croatia (calling many others into question) because the country’s process for appeals for those tried in absentia was judged to be flawed.Ukrainian courts cannot accept evidence directly from outside investigators, so international experts act only as advisers. Many advocates think this is insufficient. “It’s not enough to send us hundreds of international consultants,” says Oleksandra Matviichuk, a human-rights lawyer whose Centre for Civil Liberties was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. Ukraine lacks “working hands on the ground”, she adds. Some Ukrainian NGOs, including Ms Matviichuk’s group, call for setting up hybrid courts that could accept foreign investigators and prosecutors.Meanwhile, war-crimes efforts involving foreign countries and courts are almost indescribably complex. “The space has become overcrowded,” says Nadia Volkova of the Ukrainian Legal Advisory Group, an NGO. Ukraine has granted jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. (In March that court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin himself, along with his minister of children’s welfare, over Russia’s mass abductions of children.) Meanwhile six eastern European countries—Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia—have pooled their war-crimes efforts with Ukraine’s in a Joint Investigation Team. The EU has created a database for war-crimes evidence at its justice agency, Eurojust. It also wants to host a new tribunal to try Russia on the charge of aggression, which the ICC probably cannot pursue against countries which reject its jurisdiction. America, Britain and individual European countries periodically send Ukraine forensic and legal experts, and collect testimony from Ukrainian refugees. Some may pursue war-crimes charges under universal-jurisdiction laws. The Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), an initiative between America, Britain and the EU, is supposed to co-ordinate those countries’ efforts with Ukrainian prosecutors. Unsurprisingly, it is finding that hard to do.Many of these issues may be teething problems. But others are tougher. Ukraine’s situation is not like that at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, where conquering powers imposed justice on a defeated nation. It is also unlike those in Cambodia, Sierra Leone or the former Yugoslavia, where civil wars gave way to tribunals sponsored by the international community–a phrase which at the time meant something.Rather, for now, in Ukraine the overwhelming majority of war-crimes cases will be prosecuted in national courts. The invaded country will pass judgment on the invader’s soldiers, who may be in Russia and untouchable for many years to come. Klaus Hoffmann, a German prosecutor who works with the ACA, notes that the London declaration on the punishment of war crimes was issued in 1942 when the Nazi leadership was still out of reach. Justice, Mr Hoffmann, says, will come after the fighting is over. ■Changing from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?On Russia, Syria and the Kurds, the country’s interests would remain much the same"
50,The West struggles to respond forcefully to Russia’s war in Ukraine,,25/02/22,"“PUTIN’S AGGRESSION against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly, economically and strategically. We will make sure of that.” With these fighting words, President Joe Biden announced on February 24th that America would impose sweeping economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The measures freeze the American assets of Russia’s biggest banks, hamper its ability to raise debt, restrict its import of high-tech goods and seize the wealth of its elites and their children. Britain and the EU announced similar steps.But those who imagined that sanctions would cripple Russia’s economy overnight are likely to be disappointed, if only because much of the world still wants its oil and gas. And the West has signalled that, for all its horror at Mr Putin’s wanton aggression, it will not act militarily against a nuclear power. Instead, America and Europe seem to hope that opprobrium, economic pressure, the grind of war and, perhaps, discontent at home, will eventually convince Mr Putin to pull back—or at least not advance further. Mr Biden denounced the brutality of Russia’s “war without a cause”, and hailed the unity of the West in the “contest between democracy and autocracy”. Yet the West is confronting a sobering failure: its ever-greater resort to sanctions as a tool of foreign policy has only a limited impact. One reason is that they also inflict pain on those who wield them, often unevenly.After months of threatening “massive” sanctions, Mr Biden says he never pretended that sanctions could deter Mr Putin from going to war. Instead, he says they are now intended to sap Russia’s strength in the long term, to the point of turning it into “a secondary power”. He predicted: “Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy…Between our actions and those of our allies and partners, we estimate we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.” The West’s response, however, remains far from exhaustive. Mr Biden was keen to highlight the fall of the Russian currency and its stockmarkets. But he was discomfited by the increase in energy prices as Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, briefly soared above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. A notable exclusion from the sanctions were Russia’s big energy companies. And America’s financial restrictions are allowing “energy payments” to continue. “My administration is using the tools—every tool at our disposal—to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump,” said Mr Biden, warning oil and gas companies not to “exploit” this moment to raise prices. He said that personal sanctions against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, were “on the table”, but there was no sign of them. After a day of frenetic consultations among Western leaders, several of Ukraine’s calls for tougher action were left unanswered. These include the severing of Russia from the SWIFT system of financial transactions, the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and the closure (by Turkey) of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles straits for Russian vessels sailing between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, implored the world to act firmly: “If you my dear European leaders, my dear world leaders, leaders of the free world, don’t help us today, if you do not strongly help Ukraine, then tomorrow war will knock on your doors.” For all the support given to Ukraine in the form of money and weapons, America has drawn a clear line between countries that are in NATO, which must be defended, and those that remain outside, like Ukraine, which must fend for themselves. That may give countries like Sweden and Finland renewed cause to consider joining the alliance.Even within NATO’s domain, the allies have been at pains to indicate military restraint. They will be doubly cautious now that rival planes, ships and ground forces are operating in close proximity along the borders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Mr Biden said America was sending more troops to Europe and would help defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but would not be drawn into the fighting in Ukraine. “Let me say it again. Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east.”NATO’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that “peace in our continent has been shattered”. NATO had activated its “defence plans”, which give commanders more leeway, but has not yet deployed the NATO Response Force, its 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force. As NATO leaders prepared for a video summit on February 25th, Mr Stoltenberg admitted: “We don’t have all the answers today.” He emphasised the importance of “deconfliction”, ie, avoiding the risk of inadvertent clashes, between NATO and Russian forces, and that “what we do is defensive, is measured and we do not seek confrontation.”American hawks, such as John Bolton, a national-security adviser under Donald Trump, blame the war on Mr Biden’s “weakness”. In Mr Bolton’s view the feebleness dates to the time of George W. Bush, who did not stop Mr Putin from going to war in Georgia in 2008. It is especially true of Mr Trump, whom Mr Bolton served and who this week praised Mr Putin as “very savvy”. Mr Bolton said: “There’s a lot of tough talk in Brussels. And all that tough talk won’t buy you a cup of coffee.” In his view, America should have deployed troops to Ukraine months ago to act as a deterrent; now it’s “too late”.Meeting in Brussels, national leaders of the EU’s 27 states castigated Russia for the “unprovoked and unjustified military action”. They agreed on the need for “massive and severe consequences”. Sanctions are also to be meted out against Belarus, which aided Russia with its attack. However the details of the measures have yet to be revealed. Some EU members—notably Germany and Italy—are less hawkish than hardliners in Poland and the Baltics. In general, Western sanctions aim to hit Russia in areas where they have a clear balance of economic power, such as finance and technology. The penalties on big Russian banks will make life difficult but not impossible for Russia. It has built up large reserves, sought to make itself less dependent on the dollar and can probably rely on China to help evade the restrictions. The financial shock will be counterbalanced by the bumper revenues brought by high prices for oil and gas. Calls to cut Russia off from SWIFT met resistance from several European countries, and might anyway have carried the risk of contagion in already turbulent markets. The details of sanctions on tech exports to Russia remain unclear, but their impact is likely to be felt cumulatively over years rather than days.Faced with a wall of denunciation—including an initial round of sanctions from Japan, Australia and South Korea—Russia found some solace from China, to which it has cleaved ever more closely. Hua Chunying, the Chinese foreign ministry’s chief spokesperson, declined to describe Russia’s action as an invasion, and instead blamed America: “They started the fire and fanned the flame. How are they going to put out the fire now?” And India sat uncomfortably on the fence: it has moved closer to America in recent years to offset China’s power, while remaining a long-time friend of Russia’s and a large buyer of its weapons. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, appealed for “an immediate cessation of violence”. That is unlikely. And the longer the war drags on, the more awkward India’s position will be. Some in Washington think that the ever-closer relationship between Mr Putin and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, will force India to strengthen its ties with the West. But that will probably take time. For now, the West has few good options to stop Mr Putin’s war.All of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereIt has transformed crime not only in Russia and Ukraine, but around the worldSudan is not a one-off.

51,Ukraine’s government is willing to make big concessions to end the war,,23/03/22,"AT A SECRET location in a blacked-out highrise in the suburbs of Kyiv, a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer shared what he claimed was Russia’s invasion blueprint. The classified document, supposedly compiled before Russian troops crossed the border, envisages the complete takeover of Ukraine: seizing private property and taking over banks, transport, ports and elected institutions. There are provisions for a federation of puppet “peoples’ republics” and perhaps their annexation into Russia if needed. There is a line about “denazifying” the Ukrainian education system, whatever that means.Compared with this totalitarian wishlist, peace negotiations with Russia appear to be headed to a more reasonable place. Russia is making four main demands: a declaration of Ukrainian neutrality; Ukraine’s formal acceptance that Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, is Russian territory and that the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by separatists backed by Russia, is independent; the demilitarisation of Ukraine; and relief for Russia from Western sanctions. Ukraine, for its part, appears ready to agree to several of these demands, including giving up on the prospect of NATO membership and accepting some sort of compromise on the occupied territories. Turkish and Israeli interlocutors are hailing what they describe as progress bringing the two sides together.But there are two big sticking-points. The first is Russia’s maximalist definition of demilitarisation. It wants Ukraine to reduce its army to 50,000, a fifth of its current size. After a month of bloody sacrifice, few in Ukraine are anywhere near ready to agree to such a cut. The second is the Ukrainian belief that Vladimir Putin will not pull his forces from areas of eastern and southern Ukraine they have conquered, or are about to conquer. There is bitter experience here: Russian troops remained in Donbas despite being required to withdraw under the Minsk agreements of 2014-15.Secondary discussions relate to the scope of new security guarantees for Ukraine. The talk has been of a formula involving the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Turkey; yet it is far from clear that the Western members (America, Britain and France) are ready to provide the unconditional guarantees that Ukraine is seeking. Both sides have agreed to keep the details of the talks secret. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has already indicated that any proposed settlement would be subject to a referendum. The Kremlin’s immediate response to this idea was to say that progress had become “slower and less substantive than needed”. Russian approval for any deal would no doubt come more quickly, dependent as it is on the will of just one person. But it remains to be seen whether Mr Putin is really ready to compromise, or indeed whether his negotiators have a genuine mandate.With a revealing pause and nervous laugh, the intelligence official said it was Russia’s questionable sincerity that made him pessimistic about the prospects of the negotiations. They might offer the best opportunity to avoid the “nightmarish” scenario of a protracted conflict and “Syriaisation”, or division of Ukraine into warring regions, he said. But Mr Putin did not appear to be taking the talks anywhere near as seriously as Ukraine is. That was clear in the “second tier” negotiation team he sent. “Moscow has always used peace talks to manipulate the agenda. Just like they have accused us of bombing our own people and homes.” The official predicted that Russia would continue an offensive to secure gains in the south and east of the country, completing its brutal siege of the port of Mariupol, before attempting to deny Ukraine access to the sea altogether with a renewed assault on Odessa.Ukraine’s negotiating position has been strengthened by Russia’s surprisingly mediocre military performance. The level of professionalism has varied greatly: better in units facing Ukraine’s elite forces in the south-east, much worse in the north and north-east and around Kyiv. There, Russian planners appear to have badly miscalculated, adopting a military posture that assumed minimal resistance. What is more, they failed to prepare adequately even for that rosy scenario. The intelligence officer said that Russia had gone ahead with its attack without even elementary co-ordination of its military units. It was a “miraculous” display of negligence, or sabotage, he said, which has had predictable consequences in the numbers of dead and injured.Ukraine says Russia has lost more than 15,000 soldiers since the start of the conflict, a claim that many assume to be a wild exaggeration. But on March 21st a report in Komsomolskaya Pravda, a reliably pro-government Russian newspaper, suggested that as many as 9,861 Russian soldiers had died so far, with a further 16,153 wounded. That would put roughly 13% of the original invasion force out of action, and compares badly with the total losses endured by the Soviet Union during a decade of war in Afghanistan, when some 15,000 died. The Russian tabloid later claimed that it had been hacked and removed the numbers. But even if the report was not correct, the rate of attrition seems high enough to give the Kremlin an incentive to seek a negotiated peace.Mr Zelensky has once again called for a face-to-face meeting with Mr Putin, who has so far turned down the chance to talk. Negotiations had to succeed, Mr Zelensky said, because the alternative was a “third world war”. His intelligence officer was less optimistic, predicting that war would continue until Russian forces were “completely exhausted”. Did Ukraine have the resources to bring that about? “We have to have them,” he said. “Because we don’t have an option. We want to stay alive.”The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
52,Samuel Charap considers how Russia’s war in Ukraine could escalate,,10/03/22,"RUSSIA’S ATTACK on Ukraine—horrific as it is in itself—has raised concerns in many Western capitals of an even-worse outcome: escalation to a broader war with NATO allies which could involve nuclear weapons. While such a war is far from inevitable, the possibility of the current conflict spiralling beyond the immediate theatre of hostilities is real. Understanding how that could happen is essential to minimising the risk that it does. Escalation—an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict—can occur because of a deliberate decision to up the ante, or because of a step or accident that unintentionally produces the same effect. While the American strategist Herman Kahn famously described escalation in terms of deliberate ascent up rungs on a ladder, his metaphor failed to capture this latter dynamic, which is more akin to free-falling down a ravine. The nature of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the reaction to it have opened up a wide range of escalatory pathways. Russia is conducting a large-scale military operation—involving cruise missiles, artillery, ballistic missiles, multiple-launch rocket systems and air strikes inter alia—in a country that borders four NATO allies on land and shares the Black Sea littoral with two more. Moscow also has deployed a large force to Belarus, which abuts another two members of the alliance. All eastern allies are on edge, fearful that Moscow might not plan to stop at Ukraine. America, among others, has deployed additional forces to several frontline states, including Poland and Romania, to deter any further adventurism. Meanwhile Russia’s general staff will be watching vigilantly for any sign that NATO, which it sees as the stronger party, is considering intervention in Ukraine. In these circumstances, not only are accidents more plausible, but the associated escalation risk is also higher. For example, a Russian missileer’s targeting error could send a rocket into NATO territory. In peacetime, the scenario of that accident even occurring, let alone of its leading to all-out war, is far-fetched. But not today. Both Russia and NATO are looking for any indication that the other side is preparing to fight. Current enhanced readiness and frayed nerves, along with the fog of war and the general first-mover’s advantages in modern conflict create pressure for a military response to that errant missile. As the American economist and nuclear strategist Thomas Schelling put it: “In an emergency, the urge to pre-empt—to pre-empt the other’s pre-emption, and so on ad infinitum—could become a dominant motive.” Fortunately, Washington and Moscow have set up a so-called deconfliction mechanism (essentially a communication channel between the defence ministries of each side) that provides an additional failsafe to clear up misunderstandings and avoid accidents in the first place. While such measures can help mitigate the chance of accidental escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, they cannot prevent deliberate actions to broaden the conflict. Here it is important to view recent events from the Kremlin’s vantage point, because as much as we find that perspective morally repugnant, it is hugely consequential. In the past few weeks, NATO member states—and others, including Finland—have rushed to supply the Ukrainian armed forces with additional materiel to resist the Russian attack, which inevitably will result in more Russian casualties. Press reports indicate that America is helping the Ukrainian armed forces with real-time intelligence on Russian troop movements. Volunteers from many NATO states, including veterans, are pouring into Ukraine. Meanwhile, not only the EU and America, but also a range of other countries from Singapore to Switzerland, have essentially declared economic warfare on Moscow by imposing draconian sanctions. These have sent the Russian economy into a tailspin. The sanctions have been framed exclusively as (deserved) punishment, without any hint of what Russia might do to get them lifted. Senior Western government officials have openly mused about undermining Mr Putin’s regime, and some have even expressed a desire that he be “physically eliminated”, as Luxembourg’s foreign minister put it, in remarks he soon recanted. Meanwhile, thousands of Russians have bravely taken to the streets of Russian cities to protest against Mr Putin’s war.Russian military strategists have written similar scripts in their scenarios, which lay out how NATO will go about destroying their own country. A proxy war on Russia’s periphery, a significant American buildup in Eastern Europe, Western economic warfare and fomenting of domestic unrest are steps anticipated in what they describe as a NATO operation to change the Russian regime. Even though all of his current woes result from his own aggression, Mr Putin probably views recent developments through this lens. He may now see himself engaged in an existential struggle; Mr Putin and those around him conflate the security of their regime with the security of the country. And he has now placed both at risk. Russian retaliation against NATO and other American allies thus seems a matter of when, not if—not because Moscow wants a broader conflict, but because it believes itself to be engaged in one already. In fact both sides now may actually believe, as put by Robert Jervis, the international relations scholar, “that with the infliction of a bit more pain and the running of a bit more risk, the other side [will] back down”. Under such circumstances, he concluded that “even a purely rational decision maker could participate in a cycle of destruction and counter-destruction”. And a Russian president who is facing economic and political turmoil at home might well not be in a rational frame of mind. Moscow could start with cyber-retaliation for the sanctions, since its formidable capabilities give it the opportunity to counter. The West’s financial sector may well be a plausible target, since the sanctions targeted Russia’s big banks. Mr Putin’s stakes in relations with the West and in the health of the global financial system—from which Russia has largely been ejected—are now essentially nonexistent. He may feel he has little to lose from doing damage to both. If a criminal ransomware group could shut down the largest pipeline operator on the east coast of the United States, one might reasonably assume that the Russian state could do much worse. If it does, Western government cyber-operators would likely be inclined to hit back, and from there things could spiral out of control quickly. Ongoing NATO member-state assistance to the Ukrainian armed forces or any future resistance movement represents another escalation pathway. If they succeed in taking over most or all of Ukraine, Russian forces may be tempted to interdict convoys crossing from NATO states. The Soviet Union, it should be recalled, conducted numerous air and artillery strikes into Pakistani territory during its war in Afghanistan in order to sever mujahideen supply lines. That does not mean Western assistance to Ukraine should cease, but that it should be carried out in such a way that minimises risks. In the short term, that could include greater central co-ordination of allied assistance and the avoidance of publicity about the deliveries. If a Russia-NATO conflict does ensue from one of these pathways, it is possible that Moscow would resort to use of its non-strategic—also known as tactical or battlefield—nuclear arsenal. Russia’s military doctrine explicitly allows for nuclear use in a conventional war “when the very existence of the state is threatened”. A war confined to Ukraine is unlikely to reach that threshold, particularly because Russia has significant conventional firepower remaining. But a conflict with NATO certainly could. With its conventional magazine depleted, the bulk of its combat-ready military engaged in Ukraine and the stranglehold of sanctions tightening, the Kremlin might resort to the nuclear option earlier than it would have before it attacked its neighbour.During the cold war, escalation concerns were at the top of the agenda for scholars and policymakers alike. While that did not stop East or West from engaging in a ferocious, global confrontation, it did inject enough caution to prevent the cold war from growing hot. Although major-power competition has been declared “back” for several years, it took this war to return fears of escalation to the fore. As the conflict drags on into its third week, Western leaders now face the challenge of balancing the necessity to respond to Russian aggression with the need to avoid escalation that could produce even worse outcomes. ■Samuel Charap is a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, American think-tank.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThe banking system would be stronger without it, argues the investment bankerStorytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopherLike Zionism itself, the state has become a settler-colonial movement, argues the academic and author"
53,Senior Colonel Zhou Bo says the war in Ukraine will accelerate the geopolitical shift from West to East,,14/05/22,"IF THE ENEMY of my enemy is my friend, is the enemy of my friend also my enemy? Not necessarily. Or so China’s thinking goes when it comes to the raging Russian-Ukranian war. On the one hand China is Russia’s strategic partner. On the other, China is the largest trading partner of Ukraine. Beijing therefore tries painstakingly to strike a balance in its responses to the war between two of its friends. It expresses understanding of Russia’s “legitimate concerns” over NATO’s expansion, while underlining that “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected”.Such carefully calibrated neutrality may not be what the warring parties really want, but it is acceptable to both. If China joins the West in condemning Russia, it will be much applauded in Washington and most European capitals. But it will lose Russia’s partnership. And it is only a matter of time before America takes on China again. The Biden administration’s policy towards my country is “extreme competition” that stops just short of war.Obviously, the conflict in Ukraine has done tremendous damage to Chinese interests, including its Belt and Road initiative in Europe. But Beijing sympathises with Moscow’s claim that the root cause of the conflict is NATO’s inexorable expansion eastward after the fall of the Soviet Union. All Russian leaders since Mikhail Gorbachev have warned of the consequences of such expansion. Russia feels that it cannot allow its Ukrainian brethren to leave Russkiy mir—the Russian world—to join another camp. If NATO looks like Frankenstein’s monster to Russia, with new additions here and there, Vladimir Putin probably believes he must slay the creature.The future of Europe is not hard to fathom. Mr Putin’s all-out war against Ukraine has failed. Precisely because of that, he will fight until he can declare some sort of “victory”. Presumably this will involve Ukraine’s acceptance that Crimea is part of Russia, its promise not to join NATO and the independence of the two “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. The challenge is whether Russian troops are able to control Donbas after occupying it.A protracted war looks probable, if not inevitable. The situation bears similarities to the one in Afghanistan during Russia’s war there in the 1980s. An American-led alliance sent endless weapons to the mujahideen who managed to bog down and exhaust the invading Soviet soldiers.Thanks to the crisis, a brain-dead NATO has revived. In February Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, created a special €100bn ($105bn) fund for defence and announced that his country would spend 2% of its GDP on defence every year—a NATO guideline. It will beef up the alliance and bolster the idea of European “strategic autonomy” (little more than a French slogan until now).The irony is that the more popular NATO becomes, the more insecure Europe will be. If Finland joins NATO, as looks likely, the alliance’s troops would be a stone’s throw from St Petersburg. The Kremlin has warned that such a move would end the “non-nuclear status of the Baltic Sea”. This could be a bluff. But who knows? If NATO’s worst fear is that Russia might launch a tactical nuclear attack, then why keep poking Mr Putin in the eyes? Europe’s security, now as in the past, can only be achieved with Russia’s co-operation.In recent months speculation abounded that Beijing and Moscow’s “unlimited” partnership—announced during Mr Putin’s visit to China in February for the Winter Olympics—might usher in a military alliance. But the war in Ukraine has inadvertently proved that Beijing and Moscow’s rapprochement is not an alliance. China didn’t provide military assistance to Russia. Instead it provided humanitarian aid and money to Ukraine twice, including food and sleeping bags, and has pledged to continue to “play a constructive role”.One reason behind the Sino-Russian non-alliance is that it allows a comfortable flexibility between two partners. And in spite of the fact that China and Russia both call for a multipolar world, a non-alliance suits them because they see such a world differently. Mr Putin’s Russia is nostalgic for the heyday of the Soviet empire. (He lamented its demise as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.) Russia sees itself as a victim of the existing international order. By contrast China is the largest beneficiary of the rules and regulations of global commerce and finance made by the West after the second world war. China has a huge stake in safeguarding the existing international order. This is why, despite ideological differences and even tensions sometimes, China has at least maintained robust economic ties with the West. Neither side wishes to sever them.How America can focus simultaneously on two theatres—the Indo-Pacific and war in Europe—remains to be seen. Joe Biden had hoped to put Russia policy on a “stable and predictable” footing in order to focus on America’s Indo-Pacific strategy. The war in Ukraine undoubtedly will distract America’s attention and syphon away resources. It will further hollow out Mr Biden’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which already has too many aims and too few tools and not enough supporters. The question is for how long Mr Biden will allow Ukraine to remain a distraction. In a region where China is the largest trading partner of most countries, even America’s greatest allies wouldn’t wish to sacrifice their relationship with China for the benefit of America.Is the Russia-Ukraine war a turning point that heralds new global disorder? Rumour has it that when China’s Premier Zhou Enlai was asked what he thought of the French Revolution of 1789, he supposedly said that it was too early to tell. But perhaps it isn’t too early to say that the war in Ukraine will accelerate the geopolitical and economic shift from the West to the East. China standing in the centre matters all the more, and it should stand firm as a stabiliser._______________Senior Colonel Zhou Bo is a retired officer of the People’s Liberation Army and a senior fellow at the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, Beijing and a China Forum expert.This article appeared in the By Invitation section of the print edition under the headline ""Senior Colonel Zhou Bo says the war in Ukraine will accelerate the geopolitical shift from West to East""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The banking system would be stronger without it, argues the investment bankerStorytelling computers will change the course of human history, says the historian and philosopherLike Zionism itself, the state has become a settler-colonial movement, argues the academic and author"
54,How Ukraine is fighting back against Russian artillery,,02/06/22,"As the focus of the war in Ukraine has turned to the eastern Donbas region, Russia is trying to beat down Ukrainian defences and make incremental advances. One important way of doing this is through the use of heavy artillery, which is capable of indirect fire (meaning the target does not need to be within sight) over great distances. This has long been central to Russian military doctrine—Josef Stalin called it “the god of war”. In Ukraine Russia’s artillery has inflicted huge damage; images of Mariupol and other cities show neighbourhoods reduced to rubble. In doing so, however, they draw back Ukrainian artillery fire (“counter-battery” fire), leading to cat-and-mouse artillery duels. Neutralising Russian artillery is vital if Ukraine is to halt Russia’s advance. What does it take to gain the upper hand? To counter an artillery attack, the other side must know where it came from. Artillery batteries may take several minutes to hit a target, which risks making them sitting ducks in this time, partly because shells can take up to 40 seconds to arrive, and the aim needs to be adjusted if the first rounds miss. The best way to locate enemy guns is counter-artillery radar, says Patrick Benham-Crosswell, a former tank officer in the British Army and author of “The Dangerous World of Tommy Atkins: An Introduction to Land Warfare”. This detects shells in flight and traces their trajectory back to the point of origin. America has supplied Ukraine with counter-artillery radar sets, which can locate the weapons firing before the first shells land. (Russia has similar systems.) Alternatively, drones can spot the clouds of smoke produced by artillery firing. Ukraine in particular has deployed large numbers of drones, both military types and repurposed consumer models, to support its artillery. Where counter-battery fire is likely, artillery adopts a “shoot-and-scoot” tactic, firing at a target before rapidly moving on. This is only possible with self-propelled weapons such as the Russian 2S19 Msta, a 152mm gun that moves on its own tracks. Towed guns, such as the M777 155mm howitzers recently supplied to Ukraine by America, or Russia’s 152mm 2A65 Msta-B, take time to hitch and move after firing. Their crews are also in the open, making them vulnerable to shrapnel, whereas self-propelled gun crews are protected by the vehicle’s armour. Towed guns are however much cheaper and lighter (so easier for Ukraine’s allies to supply), and less complex to use. Another kind of artillery weapon, truck-mounted Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) such as the ubiquitous 40-tube BM-21 ‘Grad’ launchers used by both sides, can send a barrage quickly (albeit not terribly accurately) before moving on. Their disadvantage is that they can produce clouds of highly visible smoke. The most important factor in an artillery battle is range. The side which fires farthest can put itself out of enemy reach. The American M777 howitzer’s Excalibur GPS-guided shells, for example, have a range of more than 40km, compared with 25km for the Russian 152mm 2A65 Msta-B. A desire for longer range is behind Ukrainian requests for American-made mobile MLRS launchers. Their 270mm missiles—which also have GPS guidance—can hit targets as far as 84km away with high precision, matching or even beating Russia’s best systems. (The same launchers can also fire a single ATACMS missile over 300km, prompting worries in the West over supplying Ukraine with weapons that could hit deep in Russian territory.) On June 1st, America announced it will send advanced MLRS weapons to Ukraine, though only with medium-range missiles. Britain and Germany are reportedly planning to send similar weapons too. If Ukraine is to stand up to Russia’s artillery barrages, it will need plenty more.Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisMore from The Economist explains:Why Ukraine’s army still uses a 100-year-old machinegunHow Ukraine is winning the drone-jamming warWhy Russian forces can’t match Ukraine’s night-vision equipmentThis article appeared in the The Economist explains section of the print edition under the headline ""How Ukraine is fighting back against Russian artillery""The Reedy Creek Improvement District, set up in 1967, is an American curiosity—and made Disney World possibleThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest country"
55,Russia’s attack on Ukraine means more military spending,,05/03/22,"AS THE TRAGIC human consequences of Russia’s invasion unfold, there is little to celebrate beyond the stoic resistance of outgunned Ukrainian forces and Western unity in facing up to the unprovoked aggressor. One side-effect of the war is a sudden and profound shift in European attitudes to defence spending. Those expectations are behind a surge in the market value of firms that supply the weapons with which war is waged (see chart).Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The idiosyncratic nature of the defence industry explains why it was having a good year even before Vladimir Putin sent tanks into Russia’s smaller neighbour. Arms makers’ customers are mainly governments. Guaranteed sales translate into predictable revenues. Contracts designed to pass on cost increases shield companies against inflation. The ability to withstand rising prices was a big reason for the sector’s outperformance relative to the stockmarket as a whole in the past few months.McKinsey, a consultancy, notes that defence budgets—and so armsmakers’ revenues—are a function of threats and affordability. The spike in share prices since the attack on Ukraine reflects investors’ belief that the threats will outweigh the costs in governments’ calculations. Germany made the first move, surprising pundits with an about-turn. On February 27th it said it would spend an extra €100bn ($111bn) on defence in 2022, tripling its defence budget for the year. Besides this one-off investment, Germany aims to raise its annual spending from around 1.5% to 2% of GDP by 2024. A slug of the annual increase, equivalent to €18bn or so, will go on weapons.The Russian threat may well encourage other laggards such as Italy, the Netherlands and Spain to meet NATO’s guidelines for all members to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Citigroup, a bank, reckons that spending will now rise more rapidly and that 2% will become a de facto minimum across NATO. Jefferies, another bank, points out that if all NATO members meet the target, their combined defence budgets (excluding America’s giant one) will go up by 25% to a total of around $400bn a year. Outside NATO, Sweden and Finland, both within striking distance of Russia, are likely to ramp up spending, too.Defence spending covers an array of costs such as wages and operational expenses. Kit accounts for between a fifth and a quarter of the total. Jefferies reckons that procurement budgets in NATO (excluding America) could rise by 40-50% as armed forces gear up to face the Russian threat. Because European countries favour domestic arms manufacturers, European firms have seen the sharpest gains in their share prices. That of Rheinmetall, which makes military vehicles, weapons and ammunition, surged by nearly 70% in a matter of days. Hensoldt, a maker of military sensors, more than doubled its market value. Britain’s BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence firm, saw its share price rise by a quarter thanks to its large business serving European infantries. Thales of France and Leonardo of Italy made similar advances.For once, America’s military-industrial complex has lagged behind its European equivalent. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and L3Harris sell equipment around the world, but mostly to America’s government. The Pentagon already accounts for nearly two-fifths of global spending (or nearly half if you exclude countries such as Russia and China, which are not markets for American weapons). American military spending is unlikely to rise as sharply as Europe’s. But the revived threat from Russia will put paid to the idea, floated by some in Washington, to limit it on the margin. Russian revanchism raises the likelihood that Congress will shovel more money to the armed forces in the coming years.Bernstein, a broker, points out that past regional conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, its annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the first Gulf war in 1990, boosted defence stocks for roughly six months, while the rest of the market wilted in the fog of war. The scale of the threat to Europe and the world, and the possibility of a long confrontation in Ukraine, may mean the boost lasts longer this time. That would perpetuate a secular trend. As Bernstein observes, weapons-makers have “massively outperformed” the S&P 500 index of big American firms for more than 50 years. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline ""Advancing on all fronts""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Meet the winners from America’s consumer slowdownLess important for some, vital for othersDealmaking is the new digging"
56,The war in Ukraine has made Russian social-media users glum,,12/03/22,"T HE OUTCOME of the war in Ukraine depends on the mood in Moscow as well as the fighting near Kyiv. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, did not need popular support to launch his invasion. But should enough ordinary Russians turn against it, he might be forced to change course.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Most data on the Russian home front are unreliable. The government has limited freedom of speech and arrested thousands of protesters. A few polls do show support for the war. In two surveys last month run by government-linked firms, around 65% of respondents backed the “special military operation”. Later independent polls found that 55-59% supported the military “action” or “operation”.Such results must be taken with a cellar of salt, since the Kremlin has criminalised statements about the war that it deems false. But they still reveal political cleavages and trends over time. One poll found that being young or female, living in a big city, having a degree and not watching TV predicted anti-war views. Support may also be waning. In surveys of internet users in Moscow run by Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, the share of people blaming Russia surged during the war’s first week.Another rich source of data is social media. A team at the University of Vermont has built a measure of sentiment on these sites, using frequencies of various words and ratings of the joy or sadness they convey. Applied to Russian-language Twitter, it accurately detects happy moments like New Year’s Eve. And its fluctuations over time line up with those of a conventional poll run by Gallup, an American firm.This measure finds that Mr Putin has sent Twitter users into deep despair. Mentions of “war”, frowned upon by the Kremlin, have risen sharply, as have “scary”, “ashamed” and “horror”. Overall, posters’ mood has worsened eight times more than at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Based on past trends, this implies a one-point dip on Gallup’s one-to-ten happiness scale.Twitterati tend to be young and pro-Western, and may feel gloomier than the public at large. This bias has probably grown since Russia made it harder to load American social-media sites last month. People who still manage to post may be unusually determined or computer-savvy.However, no restrictions have been placed on VKontakte (VK), a domestic social network. And among VK posts that mention Mr Putin, the increased use of terms such as “war”, “weapon”, “death” and “crimes” indicates that, compared with 2014, when Russia sent troops into Crimea, the sentiment today is grim. ■Sources: Computational Story Lab; dorussianswantwar.com; hedonometer.org; Qualitas; Twitter; VTsIOMThis article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline ""A house divided""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The influx of grain is testing its neighbours’ solidarityThe rise of domestic cinema counters Western cultural influenceThe extremists are becoming more deadly.

57,Russia invades Ukraine,,24/02/22,"VLADIMIR PUTIN’S invasion of Ukraine, long predicted by the West and long denied by him, began before dawn on February 24th with volleys of cruise missiles, artillery and other weapons. There were explosions near Kyiv’s main airport, as well as around other cities. The scope of the attack was not immediately clear, but all the evidence pointed to a large-scale operation. Early reports, still unconfirmed, said Russian troops were advancing on the eastern city of Kharkiv. The mayor of Odessa, a big port, said his city had been attacked, but that the attack had been repelled.Having called up reservists a day earlier and declared a state of emergency, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, imposed martial law across the country. In parts of Ukraine, people woke to the sound of sirens and took to their basements; elsewhere some knelt on the streets to pray. People rushed to take cash out of ATM machines as huge traffic jams formed on the roads leading out of Kyiv. Chillingly, Mr Putin all but threatened nuclear escalation against the West after America and its allies sent additional troops to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO. Russia, Mr Putin pointed out, is one of the greatest nuclear powers in the world, adding: “A few words to those who might be tempted to interfere in the unfolding events from the outside. Anyone who tries to hinder us and...create a threat for our country and our people must know that the response will be immediate and will lead to consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any scenario. All necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope you hear me.”America, which has said it will not send troops to fight in Ukraine, denounced the “unprovoked and unjustified” attack by Russia. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” said a statement from President Joe Biden. Having imposed an initial round of sanctions earlier in the week, he said he would announce further measures on February 24th. The EU, Britain and other countries look set to follow suit. A G7 video summit was called for later in the day; EU leaders are also due to discuss the crisis.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “The world must act immediately. Future of Europe & the world is at stake.” He called for “devastating” sanctions on Russia, including its exclusion from the SWIFT system for international financial transactions. He also pleaded for the West to provide Ukraine with more weapons and aid. Oil and gas prices jumped, as the Brent crude benchmark rose past $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. Global stockmarkets fell. Moscow’s exchange was suspended, following a sell-off earlier this month caused by war jitters. Civilian airliners were told to stay clear of Ukrainian airspace.Russia’s strikes began around 4:40am Kiev time, shortly after Mr Putin went on television to announce a “special military operation”. He claimed that NATO’s eastward expansion posed a threat to Russia, drawing a parallel with Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union. And he said Ukraine posed a threat, too—absurdly claiming that it was responsible for a “genocide” of Russian speakers and was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons after giving them up in 1994. He said he did not intend to occupy Ukraine, though he questioned its borders, and urged Ukrainians to lay down their weapons.Russia’s defence ministry said it was taking aim only at military targets, and had “incapacitated” Ukraine’s air defences. It denied Ukrainian claims to have shot down Russian aircraft. After weeks of fruitless diplomacy, Russia’s president proved deaf to all appeals for peace. He refused to take an eleventh-hour call from Mr Zelensky, and sent his forces into battle even as the UN Security Council was meeting in an emergency session. Ukraine’s ambassador got the last word, telling his Russian counterpart: “There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.”Mr Putin’s march to war became apparent from November, when America sounded the alarm about the movement of dozens of tactical battalion groups, the basic units of Russia’s army, towards Ukraine’s borders. By the eve of the invasion, he had deployed more than two-thirds of his country’s ground combat power around the country.Mr Putin long pretended they were on exercises; Mr Zelensky claimed that Russia was bluffing, hoping to prevent a panic that might destabilise his government and give Mr Putin victory without firing a shot. All that changed in the past week, when the Kremlin began claiming that Ukraine had committed “genocide” of Russian-speakers in the Donbas region and was about to seize two breakaway regions by force. There followed a series of alleged provocations—explosions in Donbas, and even incursions into Russia by Ukrainian troops. Western governments have said these were staged by Russia to manufacture a pretext for war.Then on February 21st Mr Putin held an extraordinary meeting of his senior officials, in which he asked each of them to endorse the recognition of the two republics on live television. He claimed Ukraine was an artificial creation of the Bolsheviks who ruled the former Soviet Union. That evening he delivered a blood-curdling speech, laying out the case for war. Russian troops, portrayed as peacekeepers, marched into the republics that evening (though some had been present semi-covertly for years). A day later Mr Putin clarified that he was recognising the pseudo-republics within the full extent of their claimed border, encompassing the entire “oblasts” or administrative regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, most of which lay beyond their control. That territory includes the port of Mariupol, a city of almost half a million people.On the eve of the invasion, Volodymyr Zelensky released a video appeal to Russians, telling them: “We don’t need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one.” He said he had tried to call Mr Putin, but was met with silence. Hours later, at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, the secretary-general, Antonio Guterres urged Russia: “President Putin stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance."" All to no avail. As the council debated, Mr Putin issued his own video complaining that: “On our historic lands, a hostile anti-Russia is being created.”Russia’s assault was met with international condemnation. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, warned of “a grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security”. South Korea said it would have “no option” but to join sanctions against Russia; earlier Australia and Japan said they would do so, too. In Russia the reaction among the foreign-policy elite was one of shock. “I will support our troops, but I still consider this a big mistake, and my support of the Russian government will further decrease,” warned Dmitry Stefanovich, a defence expert. “I have no words,” said Elena Chernenko, a journalist with Kommersant, a daily newspaper. “This is a catastrophe,” wrote Sergey Utkin of the IMEMO research institute, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. “For Russia, Ukraine and beyond.”The origins of the crisis lie in 2014, when a pro-European uprising toppled Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine’s then president, who had signed an association agreement with the European Union only to rip it up under pressure from Russia. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, responded in the same year by annexing Crimea and invading eastern Ukraine, where he established a pair of Russian proxies—the Donetsk and Luhansk “republics”—in the Donbas region. Over the succeeding eight years, as Ukraine’s government turned to the West for political and military support, Mr Putin grew more hostile.Now that hostilities are breaking out, the most immediate question is how far Russia is prepared to go to subdue its neighbour. One possibility is that it will aim to take all of the statelets’ claimed territory. A war for Donbas would be bad enough. Since January, however, Western security officials have been warning that Mr Putin is set on an even broader invasion aimed at toppling the Ukrainian government. Joe Biden, America’s president, and Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, have both said that Russia would probably aim for Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. NATO officials concur with those British and American assessments. Russian military forces in southern Belarus have crept closer to the border in recent weeks, with many organised in tactical formations that would allow a swift thrust south towards Kyiv, should Mr Putin order one. The suggestion might seem outlandish; even Western politicians familiar with the intelligence seem to disbelieve what they are hearing. After all, Ukraine’s population is over 44m, roughly double what those of Afghanistan and Iraq were when America and its allies occupied them in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Yet Western forces struggled to control both places in the face of bloody insurgencies. Even so, the Russian invasion force and those which may follow behind it, like national-guard units, “appear more than sufficient to attempt an occupation of Ukraine's eastern regions”, argues Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia’s armed forces at CNA, a think-tank.Ukraine’s eastern regions plus Kyiv amount to only 18m inhabitants, he notes, with the southern coast another 3m. That would give Russia a comparable force density ratio—the number of troops relative to the population—that America enjoyed in Iraq. Except Russia would enjoy some advantages that America did not. It knows the language, understands the terrain and would be “much more ruthless in the application of violence”, notes Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), another think-tank. Russia might also believe that at least some Ukrainians would greet them as friends, if not liberators. “Meeting with Ukrainian security officials there is a widespread acknowledgement that many of their colleagues—even in some quite senior positions—are working for or sympathetic to Russia,” argue Mr Watling and his colleague Nick Reynolds in a report published by RUSI on February 15th, based on extensive interviews with Ukrainian military and intelligence officials earlier that month. The report claims that Russian intelligence services dramatically expanded their activity in Ukraine over the past year, identifying locals who could serve as collaborators in an occupation—and also those who might lead a resistance movement. The second question is how America and its European allies will respond to the invasion. In recent weeks America has sent thousands of additional troops to Germany, Poland and Romania. Britain has also doubled the size of its contingent in Estonia, while Germany has reinforced Lithuania. Now NATO will have to further beef up its northern and southern flanks—on the Baltic and Black seas, respectively—says Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official. The alliance may activate its NATO Response Force (NRF), a 40,000-strong unit that has a high-readiness, and currently French-led, brigade as its nucleus. The force has never been used before and its activation would require unanimity from all 30 allies. Though NATO will be in “permanent crisis-management mode” for some time to come, notes Mr Shea, it will also have longer-term issues to consider. The alliance’s leaders, who planned to meet for a summit in Madrid in June, will probably convene sooner. NATO officials have been writing a new “strategic concept”, a plan for the alliance’s priorities in the years ahead. American ones have been working on a national-security strategy and a nuclear-posture review. A war in Ukraine will affect all those efforts; some will have to start from scratch, reckoning with a dramatically heightened threat from Russia. In his February 21st speech Mr Putin laid out a version of history in which, by his telling, the Russian empire was egregiously broken up by the Bolsheviks into territories that became separate independent states after the cold war. Though his explicit aim was to undermine the legitimacy of Ukraine, other former Soviet republics would have cause for alarm over his irredentism—including NATO members like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and non-NATO members like Finland, a former Russian possession. On February 22nd Finland’s foreign minister warned that Mr Putin’s actions were “based on some sort of concept of…rebuilding the Soviet Union”. All that is compounded by a de facto Russian absorption of Belarus, putting considerable Russian firepower on the border of Poland and Lithuania. That would make the slender “Suwalki gap”—a strip of land wedged between the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, which connects Poland to the Baltic states—even harder to defend in a war. “If Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he might decide that he needs a land bridge to link Kaliningrad to Belarus and then Russia running through Lithuania or Poland,” warns Stephen Hadley, who served as America’s national security adviser between 2005 and 2009. “That would mean a war between Russia and NATO.”Russia’s military moves and the Western response to them will create a more dangerous situation. “Neither Russia nor NATO want this crisis to escalate into a Russia-NATO conflict,” says Samuel Charap of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. “But with huge numbers of Russian forces conducting large-scale combat operations on NATO’s doorstep, it's very easy to imagine how things could spiral out of control quickly.” Russian and NATO fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and warships will find themselves in close and constant proximity. That is a particular concern in the Black Sea, where Russia last year fired warning shots close to a British warship that entered Crimean territorial waters. To avoid misunderstanding, Mr Charap says NATO will need to make clear to Russia that such moves to reinforce eastern Europe are not a prelude to NATO military intervention in Ukraine—something for which there is no appetite.If Western countries impose heavy economic sanctions, as they have promised, Russia may hit back in ways that further raise the temperature. A particular concern is the risk of cyber-attack, whether deliberate or inadvertent. A crude but disruptive cyber-attack struck Ukrainian government websites on February 23rd. The economic consequences may be more substantial. In itself, the direct impact of sanctions on Europe’s economy will be modest. Russia is poor relative to the rest of the continent. Its exporters depend on European demand but not vice-versa. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that the loss of trade caused by a 10% contraction in Russian demand would cost the euro zone only about 0.1% of its GDP, and Britain only about half that. The trouble is that some imports from Russia are crucial and scarce inputs to Europe’s production.In normal times Russia supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas. Although that share has fallen in recent months as Europe has increased LNG imports, an additional supply squeeze—brought about by sanctions or in retaliation for them—could disrupt Europe’s industrial production. Pricier energy will cause pain for consumers, who may cut back spending elsewhere. And if financial markets take fright at the heightening of the crisis, that will cause economic damage by reducing investment.The pain for European exporters will be spread unevenly across countries. Russia is one of the top two destinations for goods exported from both Lithuania and Latvia. It is also a significant source of external demand for Finland, Greece and Bulgaria. These places would take a larger-than-average hit from a collapse in trade. Yet the security of Finland and Bulgaria is also vulnerable to a more aggressive Russian posture, so both countries may be willing to pay a high price to shore up deterrence. Then there is the human cost. In Syria, where Russia intervened in 2015, the Kremlin’s way of war involved often indiscriminate force against populated areas, including the bombing of hospitals. Civilian casualties in Ukraine are expected to be considerable. On February 21st Mr Putin promised, ominously, that “all those guilty of crimes against Russians” would be punished. Others will flee. In eastern Europe Ukraine’s neighbours are bracing themselves for a flood of refugees. In January Ukraine’s defence minister warned that a major war would cause “the sudden appearance of between 3m and 5m Ukrainian refugees”. On February 8th Poland’s deputy interior minister said that “up to a million people” might enter Poland in the worst-case scenario. Romania’s government would struggle to absorb large numbers of refugees with the capacity it currently has in place. The growth of large refugee camps in these countries, and in Hungary, could exacerbate divisions between eastern and western Europe, while fuelling right-wing populist movements. As Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said on February 22nd, the “world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years.”Russia was not threatened by NATO or Ukraine. Its invasion of the sovereign state next door is a war of choice, conjured out of nothing by Mr Putin. History will judge him harshly. If Russia is drawn into a long-lasting partisan war, so will the Russian people.Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereThe West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
58,How cartographers track and map Russia’s war in Ukraine,,08/04/22,"MODERN MILITARY cartography dates back more than 500 years. The reproduction of these maps in the media came later, but also has a long pedigree. An early example is from 1788, when readers of the Journal Politique de Bruxelles could track the developments of the Russo-Turkish war via a map of the northern Black Sea. A chart showing Napoleon’s Russian campaign of 1812 by Charles Joseph Minard, a French civil engineer, (albeit published half a century later) is widely regarded as the best statistical graphic ever drawn. Etienne Jules Marey, a contemporary scientist, said it “defied the pen of the historian in its brutal eloquence.” Today, with Russia waging war in Ukraine, data on areas of control, bombing campaigns and refugee flows are pouring out of the country. Conflict-situation maps track these trends in meticulous detail. For readers, they offer insights into the latest developments at a glance. For their creators, they are fraught with difficulty. How are researchers tracking and mapping the war? The first challenge is gathering reliable data. Today’s cartographers have just hours to update maps with the kind of detail that would have taken their predecessors months or years to collect. A proliferation of sources helps. Mappers of the invasion of Ukraine use high-resolution satellite imagery from companies such as Maxar to track things like troop movements. Social-media posts help too. On-the-ground footage from sites such as TikTok and Twitter can be used to confirm breaking news. Thousands of experts and hobbyists study this open-source intelligence (OSINT) to confirm its veracity. Other sources include government analysis (official or leaked) and reports from national newspapers (such as Ukrayinska Pravda, Ukraine’s main online news site) and local media. Only after all these have been checked and cross-referenced will a cartographer make a judgment on whether to shade in a new advance or declare that one side controls an area.The next problem is how to interpret and depict those data. There is a fine distinction between contested and controlled areas. Consider the city of Shostka, around 260km north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. According to George Barros of the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, Shostka was quickly isolated by Russian forces in the first days of the invasion, but not occupied. Yet a massive Russian presence in the area meant defensive manoeuvres had ceased, so for military mapping purposes the city was under Russian control. (Ukrainian forces have since counter-attacked.) Conflict maps for conventional wars, such as that in Ukraine, often differ from those of insurgencies, such as Syria’s civil war. The former typically have smoother, more continuous frontlines, as mappers account for long-range artillery that help occupiers or defenders to maintain “physical influence” over swathes of land without having forces massed there. The latter’s frontlines tend to be rough and disjointed, as myriad formal and informal forces compete. But the distinction is not always clear.Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a research firm, says keeping the maps up to date is an “immensely challenging task”. The Economist’s latest maps of Ukraine use data from a number of sources including the Institute for the Study of War and Rochan. They depict Russian and Ukrainian advances (using arrows), areas assessed as under Russian control (red shading) and those that Russia claims to control (in yellow). More recently, swathes of blue denote Ukrainian counter-attacks (see top image). In earlier maps we slightly blurred the edges of Russian-controlled areas to try to convey uncertainty over the exact position of the boundaries and show that they may not be as abrupt as a crisp border would imply. And at the beginning of the war, when areas of control were too difficult to establish, we instead showed reported explosions and Russian troop crossings into Ukraine (see map above). There is more to mapping a war than just battle lines. The full human cost of the conflict in Ukraine remains uncertain, but over 4m people have been driven from the country since February 24th. The vast majority have headed to Poland, but significant numbers have gone to Hungary, Moldova, Russia and other countries. Using large arrows could bring to mind the Russian attacks that drove people to flee in the first place. Instead our data journalists used lines of people, and indicated the different number of refugees using different sized circles in each host country. In doing so they drew out a human element of the war that statistics alone could easily obscure. For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

59,How crowdfunding is shaping the war in Ukraine,,27/07/22,"THIS MONTH Aerorozvidka, a Ukrainian drone unit, celebrated the acquisition of four Chinese-made DJI Phantom 3 drones, provided by a German donor. The group, founded in 2014 after the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, is led by civilians. The gift is just one example of crowdfunding in Russia’s latest war against Ukraine. Citizens from both sides are supplying much-needed equipment to the front lines. What is the impact of these donations, and how do the two countries differ in their approach?Private citizens have chipped in to help in times of war for centuries. A writing tablet found near Hadrian’s Wall in northern England mentions a gift of sandals, socks and underwear for Roman soldiers. During the first world war America’s government asked civilians to knit warm clothing for troops. But besides such small morale-boosting efforts, some schemes to rally civilians have proved strikingly productive. During the second world war Britain introduced a “Spitfire Fund”, encouraging civilian groups to raise the £12,600 (£490,000, or $590,000, in today’s money) needed to build the top-of-the-range fighter. Individual contributors could buy wings, machineguns or even a rivet, for six old pence (two and a half modern ones) apiece. The scheme raised around £13m in total—enough for more than 1,000 aircraft (of a total of 20,000 built).Since the outbreak of war in February, Ukrainian crowdfunding has focused on high-tech gear which cannot be obtained locally, especially thermal imagers and drones. In July the government launched an international “Army of Drones” initiative to raise money and generate “dronations” of hardware. It is badly needed: though Ukraine has several domestic drone suppliers, many useful models are not produced in the country. DJI, a big Chinese manufacturer, has banned sales to both Russia and Ukraine. Private crowdfunding efforts have sprung up too. The Kalush Orchestra, who won the Eurovision Song Contest this year, auctioned their trophy, raising $900,000 for three PD-2 drones. Expat Ukrainian business tycoons in Germany have reportedly donated Vector drones worth around $200,000 each. Civilian benefactors have also supplied a 3D printer to make parts for drones and drone bombs. Social-media platforms have helped these efforts to blossom. Besides the practical benefit, they foster a sense of personal involvement in the war, extending to donors in other countries.Fundraising has also taken more creative (and grisly) forms. One website, SignMyRocket.com, allows donors to have their name inscribed on an artillery shell that is then fired at Russian soldiers. The modest sum of $150 will buy you a standard 155mm artillery shell launched from one of Ukraine’s Western-supplied M777 howitzers. Spend a bit more, $2,000, and your name will go on a grenade dropped from a Mavic 3 drone. “We guarantee that your signed [grenade] will hit a soldier,” donors are assured. “Soldiers will redo it until they get a hit on video.” The most generous benefactors can even have their name printed on the turret of a T-72 tank. “The signed tank will continue fighting the invaders with your text on it,” promises the site. Its founders are now encouraging supporters to buy ear protection for Ukrainian artillerymen, who are losing their hearing, through an Amazon wishlist.Russian crowdfunding looks superficially similar: pictures on social media typically show brand-new drones and thermal imagers. But the army is also short on essentials. Buda-Shirap Batuyev, a Communist MP allied with Vladimir Putin’s party, told local news outlets that he had attended the funerals of young soldiers whose units were as helpless as “blind kittens” because the army had not issued the requisite equipment. Civilian groups, often formed by mothers of soldiers, are sending assistance to the front lines—including basic items such as toothpaste, socks and tick spray. At least ten groups on Telegram, a social-media platform, have memberships in the thousands. In recent months they have begun to supply body armour and radios too. Russia’s sluggish military bureaucracy is accepted as a fact of life; army leadership has commended these “mum” groups for their help.Ukraine’s crowdfunding efforts are small compared with government programmes. The country’s military budget in 2021 was around $6bn; America alone has already given over $20bn in military assistance. But they are helping to sustain interest in the war abroad and getting high-tech equipment to the front lines quickly. On the Russian side, crowdfunding is a sticking plaster over more fundamental problems. Military spending has provided tanks and artillery that look good in parades but has left soldiers short of essentials that worried mothers will now struggle to supply. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.More from The Economist explains:What is mission command?Why are cluster munitions so dangerous?How war in Ukraine is changing the ArcticThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
60,Russia’s population nightmare is going to get even worse,,04/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warA DEMOGRAPHIC TRAGEDY is unfolding in Russia. Over the past three years the country has lost around 2m more people than it would ordinarily have done, as a result of war, disease and exodus. The life expectancy of Russian males aged 15 fell by almost five years, to the same level as in Haiti. The number of Russians born in April 2022 was no higher than it had been in the months of Hitler’s occupation. And because so many men of fighting age are dead or in exile, women now outnumber men by at least 10m. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.War is not the sole—or even the main—cause of these troubles, but it has made them all worse. According to Western estimates, 175,000-250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the past year (Russia’s figures are lower). Somewhere between 500,000 and 1m mostly young, educated people have evaded the meat-grinder by fleeing abroad. Even if Russia had no other demographic problems, losing so many in such a short time would be painful. As it is, the losses of war are placing more burdens on a shrinking, ailing population. Russia may be entering a doom loop of demographic decline.The roots of Russia’s crisis go back 30 years. The country reached peak population in 1994, with 149m people. The total has since zig-zagged downwards. It was 145m in 2021 (that figure, from the UN, excludes the 2.4m people of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014 and incorporated into its national accounts). According to UN projections, the total could be just 120m in 50 years, if current patterns persist. That would make Russia the 15th-most-populous country in the world, down from sixth in 1995. According to Alexei Raksha, an independent demographer who used to work for the state statistics service, if you look just at peacetime years, the number of births registered in April 2022 was the lowest since the 18th century. April was a particularly cruel month, but it was a revealing glimpse of a chronic problem.Population decline is not unique to Russia: most post-communist states have seen dips, though not like this. Their declines have been slow but also manageable. Russia’s population in recent decades has seen a precipitous slump, then a partial recovery (thanks to a period of high immigration from parts of the ex-Soviet Union and more generous child allowances after 2007), followed by a renewed fall. According to the state statistics agency, in 2020 and 2021 combined the country’s population declined by 1.3m; deaths outstripped births by 1.7m. (The UN also shows a fall, but it is shallower.) The decline was largest among ethnic Russians, whose number, the census of 2021 said, fell by 5.4m in 2010-21. Their share of the population fell from 78% to 72%. So much for Mr Putin’s boast to be expanding the Russki mir (Russian world). All this began before the war and reflects Russia’s appalling covid pandemic. The official death toll from the disease was 388,091, which would be relatively low; but The Economist estimates total excess deaths in 2020-23 at between 1.2m and 1.6m. That would be comparable to the number in China and the United States, which have much larger populations. Russia may have had the largest covid death toll in the world after India, and the highest mortality rate of all, with 850-1,100 deaths per 100,000 people. If you add pandemic mortality to the casualties of war and the flight from mobilisation, Russia lost between 1.9m and 2.8m people in 2020-23 on top of its normal demographic deterioration. That would be even worse than during the disastrous early 2000s, when the population was falling by roughly half a million a year. What might that mean for Russia’s future? Demography is not always destiny; and Russia did for a while begin to reverse its decline in the mid-2010s. The impact of population change is often complex, as Russia’s military mobilisation shows. The decline in the number of ethnic Russians of call-up age (which is being raised from 18-27 to 21-30) will make it harder for the armed forces to carry out the regular spring draft, which begins in April. Such complications notwithstanding, the overall effect of demographic decline will be to change Russia profoundly—and for the worse. Most countries which have suffered population falls have managed to avoid big social upheavals. Russia may be different. Its population is falling unusually fast and may drop to 130m by mid-century. The decline is associated with increased misery: the life expectancy at birth of Russian males plummeted from 68.8 in 2019 to 64.2 in 2021, partly because of covid, partly from alcohol-related disease. Russian men now die six years earlier than men in Bangladesh and 18 years earlier than men in Japan.And Russia may not achieve what enables other countries to grow richer as they age: high and rising levels of education. Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, argues that the country presents a peculiar combination of third-world mortality and first-world education. It has some of the highest rates of educational attainment among over-25s in the world. But the exodus of well-educated young people is eroding this advantage. According to the communications ministry, 10% of IT workers left the country in 2022. Many were young men. Their flight is further skewing Russia’s unbalanced sex ratio, which in 2021 meant there were 121 females older than 18 for every 100 males. The demographic doom loop has not, it appears, diminished Mr Putin’s craving for conquest. But it is rapidly making Russia a smaller, worse-educated and poorer country, from which young people flee and where men die in their 60s. The invasion has been a human catastrophe—and not only for Ukrainians. ■This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""The disappeared""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
61,Sir Richard Barrons on how the characteristics of war are changing,,09/02/23,"THE INVASION of Ukraine is a graphic illustration of how the nature of war never changes. It is an aspect of the human condition that is as irrational, brutal, feral, unbounded and disappointing now as it has been since man first took up a stick against his fellow. When people fight knowing that their personal survival—and that of their families, communities and countries—is at stake, there are no unbreakable laws or boundaries that limit what is done to survive and win.It is equally true that although the nature of war does not change, its characteristics—how it is actually fought—change constantly according to circumstances, technology and thinking. Today that thinking is mostly about how to apply digital technologies created in the civilian sector to create new ways of operating and organising in conflicts. Some aspects of the war in Ukraine feel familiar; others are changing at the speed of innovation under existential pressure.One constant is that big wars, where the survival of a country and its way of life are at stake, are won by mobilising civil society. Regular armed forces will be in the vanguard and provide the spine of leadership and organisation. But the numbers required to fight on fronts of hundreds of kilometres over many years come only by putting a significant proportion of the civilian population in uniform. This effort is matched by the mobilisation of industry and the wider economy to support the war. Consider that Vladimir Putin has set aside 30% of Russia’s budget this year to pay for defence, security and law enforcement. This 9trn rubles ($143bn) is a huge increase on past years. Another constant is that battles for territory are still dominated by the artillery that brings death and destruction within ranges of about 30km (19 miles). Artillery is the essential partner to tanks and infantry as they fire and move to seize and hold ground. This is as true now in Ukraine, albeit with better equipment, as it was on D-Day in 1944. Success also hinges on how air power (bombs and rockets delivered by jets and helicopters) can impose sudden and decisive results on the ground, and how air defences can prevent that from happening. This is not something that cyber or precision missiles can do. The idea that cyber would make jets, tanks and guns obsolete was always a fantasy. Countries such as Britain that cut spending on conventional armed forces to pay for cyber programmes now see that the two are needed together. In Ukraine modern technology has made massive changes to the characteristics of war, however. The use of satellite imagery to see and locate enemy positions from space has made the war in Ukraine in essence transparent. That is thanks to the data provided from both expensive, capable geo-stationary military satellites and cheap, commercial low-Earth-orbit satellites and drones. A combination of space-based capability and pervasive open-source data means it is no longer possible to move many members of an army, navy or air force undetected. The Russian invasion was monitored in minute detail for some months before it started and has been ever since. Meanwhile access to the internet (as provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink in Ukraine) through multitudinous devices, as well as artificial intelligence and the volume and speed of data enabled by cloud computing are all contributing to the fight and helping determine who gets an edge. Starlink allows every Ukrainian soldier with a ground terminal access to a centrally managed, common picture of the situation on the ground. Most units have at least one terminal. It connects all the available ways of identifying and locating a target–from special forces to drones to mobile-phone photos–to data in the cloud through rapidly developing AI apps that screen and prioritise them. These apps then send the targets to the most appropriate weapon system. The whole apparatus means that targets can be processed ten times faster than ever before. It is also able to identify and locate targets that are deep in Russian-held territory.Another new characteristic of this war, for all the enduring need for artillery, is the primacy of precision weapons over the major military platforms that have dominated the battlefield for more than 100 years. Ships, tanks, aircraft, large logistic bases, civil infrastructure and headquarters are more vulnerable than ever before. Radar and precision missiles mean the fastest jet or cruise missile can be shot down from several hundred kilometres away. It is possible to hit not just a given building but a given window. This could be used to reduce the harm done to civilians. But there is no doubt that Russia deliberately uses the accuracy of precision missiles to target hospitals and other civil buildings.Precision technology also means that hitherto dominant equipment, such as tank and artillery units, are far more vulnerable and so are comparatively less effective. The American-provided HIMARS high-precision rockets deplete Russia’s ability to bring forward artillery and ammunition, for example. Tanks can still win victories in close-quarter battles, of course. But precision technology offers the ability to destroy an enemy’s major weapons systems, logistics and reserves before close-quarter battle even starts. The primacy of precision is such an important new characteristic of war that it may determine the outcome in Ukraine. The victor may be whoever wins the race for cheap, precise technologies. Neither Russia nor Ukraine started with the stockpiles of missiles needed to sustain their initial rate of use for more than a few months. Neither side has the industrial capabilities in place to scale up missile production quickly enough to meet demand. So precision drones are being rolled out instead. The Iranian Shaheed-136 supplied to Russia at $20,000 a shot is far cheaper than the $1m that might be paid for a cruise missile (though Russia is trying to buy missiles, too). Vast quantities of such drones can also be made quickly. Whichever side can ramp up their supplies of expensive missiles while at the same time massing cheap drones will gain an edge. And the world’s armed forces will watch to see what the winning combination turns out to be.The war in Ukraine is a showcase of how the characteristics of conflict are changing in the 21st century. True, it is not America and China fighting with their superpower strength and technology. Yet in terms of the high stakes and the speed of competitive innovation, it is still breathtaking. And these innovations are part of an evolving orchestra of war involving players and conductors who are learning as they go. What happens in Ukraine will be a benchmark for how countries prepare for and fight the next major conflict. ■General Sir Richard Barrons is a British Army officer.

62,Commodity prices jump as Russia goes to war,,24/02/22,"Egypt is not an obvious victim of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But as the world’s biggest consumer of wheat, much of which is grown in Russia and Ukraine, it may find itself caught in the crossfire. Combined, the two countries export almost a third of the world’s supply. Egyptians, along with other global consumers, now face higher prices. By the morning of February 24th, when Russia’s invasion began, wheat prices had risen by 20% since the start of the year. Investors are fearful that sanctions and conflict might disrupt global supply.Wheat is not the only commodity to have climbed in price. Russia provides Europe with much of its fuel: it is the world’s second-largest exporter of oil and the biggest exporter of natural gas. Energy prices have spiked accordingly. Oil prices jumped above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on February 24th, before falling back down again. European natural gas prices shot up by 50% on the day, which will affect other markets. The share prices of gas-tanker manufacturers rose after Germany mothballed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, built to carry more Russian gas to Europe, on February 22nd. Investors reckon that the continent will need more tankers as it increases its reliance on liquefied natural gas. Russia’s presence in mining has also sent metal prices skyward. In 2020 the country produced 43% of the world’s palladium, a component of catalytic converters in cars. The metal’s price has risen by 23% this year. Russia also produces 11% of the world’s supply of nickel and a smaller share of aluminium and copper.Higher commodity prices could boost Russia’s export earnings—as long as sanctions allow other countries to buy from Russia. That benefit will not outweigh the damage being done to Russia’s economy, reflected in a falling stockmarket and currency. The stockmarket closed down by 38% on February 24th and has lost half its value this year. The rouble has fallen by 12% against the dollar. But Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, may take some comfort in the knowledge that his people are not the only ones hurt by his actions. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

63,Ukraine fights on,,19/03/22,"“REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR,” Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, entreated America’s Congress. “Remember September 11th…Every night for three weeks, in various Ukrainian cities, Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death.” Mr Zelensky was not asking for pity. He was asking for a no-fly zone or, failing that, for arms. “I have a dream. I have a need. I need to protect our skies,” he pleaded—surely the first man to invoke Martin Luther King Jr in pursuit of surface-to-air missiles.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Shortly before Mr Zelensky began his speech on March 16th, Russian television broadcast an address given by Vladimir Putin, his counterpart. Where Mr Zelensky appealed to his listeners in the name of all Ukrainians, Mr Putin set Russian against Russian. “Fifth columnists and traitors,” he snarled, would be spat out “like midges that flew into [the Russian people’s] mouth”. The need for cleansing Russia of such “scum” was evoked with disconcertingly familiar fascist rhetoric. “I am convinced that such natural and necessary self-purification of our society will only strengthen our country [and] cohesion.”The war, the dictator insisted, was “going to plan”. If that is his opinion then his minions are keeping him from the truth. According to American defence sources, 10% of Russia’s invasion force has been lost, presumably either killed or wounded. It is shy at least 233 tanks, 32 surface-to-air missile launchers and 41 planes, drones and helicopters, according to Oryx, a blog which tracks such weapons using pictures made public on the internet. On top of that which has been destroyed, a fair bit of workable Russian kit has been captured—much of it towed away gleefully, and on video, by farmers with tractors.These are severe losses of men and materiel. What is more, they seem to have fallen disproportionately on elite units such as the VDV airborne forces, Spetsnaz special forces and the First Guards Tank Army, an armoured force purportedly both well trained and equipped. British defence intelligence says that these losses are so severe that they have left Russia “struggling to conduct offensive operations”. It has been forced to redeploy forces from its eastern military district (which stretches to Vladivostok), from its Pacific fleet and from Armenia; it is also recruiting Russian and Syrian mercenaries.This is a high price for what are, as yet, relatively scant gains. In the east, Russia is stuck at the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city it tried and failed to take on the war’s first day. In Sumy, north-west of Kharkiv, Russian tanks have been spotted lodged in the mud—a problem that will only grow as Ukraine’s spring thaw gets going.Russian forces are firmly positioned 15-20km to the north-west of the centre of Kyiv and 20-30km to the east of it, and other suburbs around the capital are being laid waste. More and more rockets and missiles have been hitting the city.But that fire has been returned. Ukrainian artillery is being dug in around the city and mobile missile-launchers deployed. Supermarket shelves are far from full but food has not run out. The water, electricity and gas utilities are still working. Morale remains high. “I have never so much as killed a chicken,” says Vladislav, a 52-year-old electrician who was watching television when missiles hit the district in which he lives on March 14th. “But now I’d kill that Putin bastard.” Ukrainian control over corridors to the south of the city keep it connected to the rest of the country, and thus the world—witness the visit there by the Czech, Polish and Slovenian prime ministers on March 15th.Such connections are not just symbolic. They can bring supplies. Perhaps Ukraine’s second-biggest advantage is that Western arms are still pouring into the country. On March 15th the Joint Expeditionary Force, a British-led ten-nation bloc of northern European states, agreed to “co-ordinate, fund and supply” more weaponry. On March 16th America announced $800m in new security assistance to Ukraine. The package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and 2,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles. It also contains 100 unspecified drones which are thought to be Switchblades, loitering munitions that can strike tanks from up to 40km away. On a forthcoming trip to Slovakia and Bulgaria, Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, is expected to ask both allies to provide Ukraine with longer-range Russian-made air-defence systems from their arsenals, such as the S-300.The only thing which may be more important to Ukraine’s defence than these supplies is the morale they help keep up. Ukrainian troops are defiant, confident and buoyed—not to say surprised—by their success not just in holding out for three weeks when many Western experts thought the war would be over in days, but in imposing serious losses on enemy forces which have, in some places, come close to a standstill.Russian forces advancing north out of Crimea have, by and large, made more progress than those coming south from Belarus and Russia. But there, too, some assaults have become bogged down. In the south-west, Russian forces appear to be stuck at Mykolaiv, a port which guards the road to Odessa. They have been unable to assault it, capture it from the sea or bypass it. Their response, as is often the case with Russia’s army, has been to shell it. Rockets have landed in the city’s zoo on at least three occasions. The tail of one Smerch rocket is stuck inside the bird enclosure; the peacocks have not been the same since, say staff. “After three weeks of this idiot’s genocidal war,” says a deputy zookeeper, “It really would be the icing on the cake; to see lions, tigers and leopards free to roam.”But Russia’s military dysfunction and Ukraine’s thumping victory in the information war may have obscured some of the country’s vulnerabilities, especially those which are some way away from the besieged, battered but defiant cities. Stymied though Russia may be at Mykolaiv, it has been advancing quite quickly towards Kryvyi Rih, a city around 150km (90 miles) to the north-east. If that manoeuvre pans out, it would weaken Ukraine’s hold on Dnipro, a larger city which controls vital crossing points over the Dnieper river.Should Russian forces also manage to break out past Kharkiv and move south, a pincer movement formed by the two advances could isolate the Ukrainian forces facing the Russian separatists in the east of the country. The Ukrainian forces in this area, known as the Joint Forces Operation, are thought to comprise a sizeable fraction of the regular army. In a letter sent to his officers on March 9th, General Thierry Burkhard, France’s chief of defence staff, warned that Ukraine, “faced with the difficulty of holding a stretched position, without any operational reserve, could experience a sudden collapse”. In the long run, losing its army in the field would bode ill for Ukraine’s chances.Perhaps mindful of their respective weaknesses and losses—the civilian toll in Ukraine has been hard, especially in Mariupol—Russia and Ukraine seem to have become more seriously engaged in negotiations that could bring about a ceasefire or end the war. Mr Zelensky, who in recent days has acknowledged that Ukraine “will not enter” NATO, insisted that the Russians were sounding “more realistic” about a settlement. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on March 16th that the two sides were “close to agreeing” a deal that would involve a neutral Ukraine receiving guarantees about its security. That said, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, has been quoted as saying the Russians are only pretending to negotiate.Likely sticking-points are not limited to the territory at stake (Russia will want to keep its gains in Donbas, including Mariupol, should it succeed in taking the city). What sort of security guarantees are offered, and by whom, will matter as much or more. Mykhailo Podolyak, one of Ukraine’s negotiators, told The Economist that the only acceptable deal would be one with “specific and legally binding guarantees” under which Ukrainian allies such as America, Britain and Turkey “would be able to actively intervene in case of any aggression”. Andriy Yermak, Mr Zelensky’s chief of staff, says that the guarantors would have to include not just countries friendly to Ukraine but also all five permanent members of the UN security council.Mr Yermak also says that, although the two teams of negotiators can prepare the ground, any agreement will ultimately have to be hammered out by the two presidents. How strong their hands are will depend on the fortunes of war between now and then; the negotiations may not reach their level until there is desperation on the part of one or both of them.Come what may, though, the broadcasts of March 16th showed that Mr Zelensky will bring the goodwill of the world and the fervent expectations of his people to the table: “I would tell him ‘Fight until victory!’” says Vladislav, the electrician in Kyiv. Mr Putin’s position, meanwhile, will be shaped by a domestic situation, and an attitude to it, which are both far darker. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""No end in sight""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Its defences against Western sanctions can only stretch so farBut the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understood"
64,Momentum is building for war in Ukraine,,22/01/22,"THE FIRST WORLD WAR became inevitable once mobilisation orders had been issued in Berlin, argued A.J.P. Taylor, a British historian. The complexities of early-20th-century railway timetables, upon which troop movements then depended, made any alteration virtually impossible. Modern armies do not suffer the same constraints. But as Russia sends more and more units to Ukraine’s borders, a grim momentum is building.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Last week’s diplomacy yielded nothing. Some of Vladimir Putin’s demands are impossible for NATO to accept, as he well knew. (Essentially, he wants NATO never to admit new members, and to remove its forces from any country Russia threatens.) On January 19th President Joe Biden said that he expects Russia to “move in” on Ukraine.On January 14th hackers sabotaged Ukrainian government websites, getting them to display a poster of the Ukrainian flag and map crossed out, and warning Ukrainians to “be afraid and expect worse”. Over 100,000 Russian troops are massed on Ukraine’s eastern border, with field hospitals and fuel dumps. “Battalion tactical groups” have arrived in Belarus, a Kremlin client state north of Ukraine, in apparent preparation for a two-front attack that would divide Ukrainian forces and menace the capital, Kyiv. Only a trigger is lacking, and America says it has evidence that a “false flag” operation is planned to allow Russia to claim its men had been attacked by Ukraine. The odds of war seem perilously high.Yet it is not inevitable. The view from a satellite looking down on Russia’s tanks and guns is certainly alarming; the view presented to Russians on their television screens is anything but. The possibility of war is barely mentioned. This matters, because if Mr Putin is determined to invade Ukraine again, you would expect him to prepare the Russian public with a blaze of propaganda, as he did before annexing Crimea in 2014. That he has not suggests, perhaps, that he has yet to make up his mind.No one knows how Mr Putin assesses the risks and possible rewards of making war. But here are some things he should consider. First, if he invades Ukraine, it will hurt Russia economically. America and the EU have prepared a long list of financial and trade sanctions. Russian living standards will fall further, despite the government’s hefty reserves to cushion the blow.Second, Ukraine’s forces are more than capable of giving Mr Putin a bloody nose. They cannot stop Russia’s vastly superior forces from seizing a large portion of their territory, but they can make it a nightmare to hold it. Third, there is no support in Russia for a deadly war in Ukraine. For years, pollsters have found that most Russians prefer that their country and Ukraine would be friendly neighbours. Mr Putin’s popularity rating has been declining, like the rouble. A quixotic quest to restore the Russian empire will not revive it, especially if lots of Russians are killed. Even autocrats have to worry about the public turning against them. (Not to mention the elite, whose lives could be made uncomfortable by more sanctions.) A war that goes wrong could cost Mr Putin his grip on power—and all that goes with it. It would be a reckless gamble.The West has no foolproof way to deter him from taking it. But it should try. America’s secretary of state is due to meet his Russian counterpart on January 21st. He should offer to continue talks on topics where agreement is possible, such as missile deployments and limits on military exercises. He should rally the EU and NATO to present a united front against Russian aggression. And he should search for a face-saving way for Mr Putin to back down (while no doubt claiming victory on Russian news bulletins). War can yet be avoided, but time is running out. ■This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline ""Momentum is building for war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The country needs a new political settlement that diminishes the power of extremistsPrivate credit, not buy-outs, is stealing the limelightThe greenback is still king.

65,John Mearsheimer on why the West is principally responsible for the Ukrainian crisis,,19/03/22,"This article is part of our Summer reads series, which also includes:* Lithuania’s prime minister on the predictability of Russia’s invasion* A young Afghan woman on breaking free of the burqa* Herman Narula on why the metaverse mattersTHE WAR in Ukraine is the most dangerous international conflict since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Understanding its root causes is essential if we are to prevent it from getting worse and, instead, to find a way to bring it to a close.There is no question that Vladimir Putin started the war and is responsible for how it is being waged. But why he did so is another matter. The mainstream view in the West is that he is an irrational, out-of-touch aggressor bent on creating a greater Russia in the mould of the former Soviet Union. Thus, he alone bears full responsibility for the Ukraine crisis.But that story is wrong. The West, and especially America, is principally responsible for the crisis which began in February 2014. It has now turned into a war that not only threatens to destroy Ukraine, but also has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war between Russia and NATO.The trouble over Ukraine actually started at NATO’s Bucharest summit in April 2008, when George W. Bush’s administration pushed the alliance to announce that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members”. Russian leaders responded immediately with outrage, characterising this decision as an existential threat to Russia and vowing to thwart it. According to a respected Russian journalist, Mr Putin “flew into a rage” and warned that “if Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply fall apart.” America ignored Moscow’s red line, however, and pushed forward to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border. That strategy included two other elements: bringing Ukraine closer to the eu and making it a pro-American democracy.These efforts eventually sparked hostilities in February 2014, after an uprising (which was supported by America) caused Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, to flee the country. In response, Russia took Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.The next major confrontation came in December 2021 and led directly to the current war. The main cause was that Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO. The process started in December 2017, when the Trump administration decided to sell Kyiv “defensive weapons”. What counts as “defensive” is hardly clear-cut, however, and these weapons certainly looked offensive to Moscow and its allies in the Donbas region. Other NATO countries got in on the act, shipping weapons to Ukraine, training its armed forces and allowing it to participate in joint air and naval exercises. In July 2021, Ukraine and America co-hosted a major naval exercise in the Black Sea region involving navies from 32 countries. Operation Sea Breeze almost provoked Russia to fire at a British naval destroyer that deliberately entered what Russia considers its territorial waters.The links between Ukraine and America continued growing under the Biden administration. This commitment is reflected throughout an important document—the “us-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership”—that was signed in November by Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, and Dmytro Kuleba, his Ukrainian counterpart. The aim was to “underscore … a commitment to Ukraine’s implementation of the deep and comprehensive reforms necessary for full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions.” The document explicitly builds on “the commitments made to strengthen the Ukraine-u.s. strategic partnership by Presidents Zelensky and Biden,” and also emphasises that the two countries will be guided by the “2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration.”Unsurprisingly, Moscow found this evolving situation intolerable and began mobilising its army on Ukraine’s border last spring to signal its resolve to Washington. But it had no effect, as the Biden administration continued to move closer to Ukraine. This led Russia to precipitate a full-blown diplomatic stand-off in December. As Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, put it: “We reached our boiling point.” Russia demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become a part of NATO and that the alliance remove the military assets it had deployed in eastern Europe since 1997. The subsequent negotiations failed, as Mr Blinken made clear: “There is no change. There will be no change.” A month later Mr Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine to eliminate the threat he saw from NATO.This interpretation of events is at odds with the prevailing mantra in the West, which portrays NATO expansion as irrelevant to the Ukraine crisis, blaming instead Mr Putin’s expansionist goals. According to a recent NATO document sent to Russian leaders, “NATO is a defensive Alliance and poses no threat to Russia.” The available evidence contradicts these claims. For starters, the issue at hand is not what Western leaders say NATO’s purpose or intentions are; it is how Moscow sees NATO’s actions.Mr Putin surely knows that the costs of conquering and occupying large amounts of territory in eastern Europe would be prohibitive for Russia. As he once put it, “Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.” His beliefs about the tight bonds between Russia and Ukraine notwithstanding, trying to take back all of Ukraine would be like trying to swallow a porcupine. Furthermore, Russian policymakers—including Mr Putin—have said hardly anything about conquering new territory to recreate the Soviet Union or build a greater Russia. Rather, since the 2008 Bucharest summit Russian leaders have repeatedly said that they view Ukraine joining NATO as an existential threat that must be prevented. As Mr Lavrov noted in January, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”Tellingly, Western leaders rarely described Russia as a military threat to Europe before 2014. As America’s former ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul notes, Mr Putin’s seizure of Crimea was not planned for long; it was an impulsive move in response to the coup that overthrew Ukraine’s pro-Russian leader. In fact, until then, NATO expansion was aimed at turning all of Europe into a giant zone of peace, not containing a dangerous Russia. Once the crisis started, however, American and European policymakers could not admit they had provoked it by trying to integrate Ukraine into the West. They declared the real source of the problem was Russia’s revanchism and its desire to dominate if not conquer Ukraine.My story about the conflict’s causes should not be controversial, given that many prominent American foreign-policy experts have warned against NATO expansion since the late 1990s. America’s secretary of defence at the time of the Bucharest summit, Robert Gates, recognised that “trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching”. Indeed, at that summit, both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, were opposed to moving forward on NATO membership for Ukraine because they feared it would infuriate Russia.The upshot of my interpretation is that we are in an extremely dangerous situation, and Western policy is exacerbating these risks. For Russia’s leaders, what happens in Ukraine has little to do with their imperial ambitions being thwarted; it is about dealing with what they regard as a direct threat to Russia’s future. Mr Putin may have misjudged Russia’s military capabilities, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance and the scope and speed of the Western response, but one should never underestimate how ruthless great powers can be when they believe they are in dire straits. America and its allies, however, are doubling down, hoping to inflict a humiliating defeat on Mr Putin and to maybe even trigger his removal. They are increasing aid to Ukraine while using economic sanctions to inflict massive punishment on Russia, a step that Putin now sees as “akin to a declaration of war”.America and its allies may be able to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine, but the country will be gravely damaged, if not dismembered. Moreover, there is a serious threat of escalation beyond Ukraine, not to mention the danger of nuclear war. If the West not only thwarts Moscow on Ukraine’s battlefields, but also does serious, lasting damage to Russia’s economy, it is in effect pushing a great power to the brink. Mr Putin might then turn to nuclear weapons.At this point it is impossible to know the terms on which this conflict will be settled. But, if we do not understand its deep cause, we will be unable to end it before Ukraine is wrecked and NATO ends up in a war with Russia.John J. Mearsheimer is the R.

66,The coming food catastrophe,,19/05/22,"By invading ukraine, Vladimir Putin will destroy the lives of people far from the battlefield—and on a scale even he may regret. The war is battering a global food system weakened by covid-19, climate change and an energy shock. Ukraine’s exports of grain and oilseeds have mostly stopped and Russia’s are threatened. Together, the two countries supply 12% of traded calories. Wheat prices, up 53% since the start of the year, jumped a further 6% on May 16th, after India said it would suspend exports because of an alarming heatwave.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The widely accepted idea of a cost-of-living crisis does not begin to capture the gravity of what may lie ahead. António Guterres, the un secretary general, warned on May 18th that the coming months threaten “the spectre of a global food shortage” that could last for years. The high cost of staple foods has already raised the number of people who cannot be sure of getting enough to eat by 440m, to 1.6bn. Nearly 250m are on the brink of famine. If, as is likely, the war drags on and supplies from Russia and Ukraine are limited, hundreds of millions more people could fall into poverty. Political unrest will spread, children will be stunted and people will starve. Mr Putin must not use food as a weapon. Shortages are not the inevitable outcome of war. World leaders should see hunger as a global problem urgently requiring a global solution.Russia and Ukraine supply 28% of globally traded wheat, 29% of the barley, 15% of the maize and 75% of the sunflower oil. Russia and Ukraine contribute about half the cereals imported by Lebanon and Tunisia; for Libya and Egypt the figure is two-thirds. Ukraine’s food exports provide the calories to feed 400m people. The war is disrupting these supplies because Ukraine has mined its waters to deter an assault, and Russia is blockading the port of Odessa.Even before the invasion the World Food Programme had warned that 2022 would be a terrible year. China, the largest wheat producer, has said that, after rains delayed planting last year, this crop may be its worst-ever. Now, in addition to the extreme temperatures in India, the world’s second-largest producer, a lack of rain threatens to sap yields in other breadbaskets, from America’s wheat belt to the Beauce region of France. The Horn of Africa is being ravaged by its worst drought in four decades. Welcome to the era of climate change.All this will have a grievous effect on the poor. Households in emerging economies spend 25% of their budgets on food—and in sub-Saharan Africa as much as 40%. In Egypt bread provides 30% of all calories. In many importing countries, governments cannot afford subsidies to increase the help to the poor, especially if they also import energy—another market in turmoil. The crisis threatens to get worse. Ukraine had already shipped much of last summer’s crop before the war. Russia is still managing to sell its grain, despite added costs and risks for shippers. However, those Ukrainian silos that are undamaged by the fighting are full of corn and barley. Farmers have nowhere to store their next harvest, due to start in late June, which may therefore rot. And they lack the fuel and labour to plant the one after that. Russia, for its part, may lack some supplies of the seeds and pesticides it usually buys from the European Union. In spite of soaring grain prices, farmers elsewhere in the world may not make up the shortfall. One reason is that prices are volatile. Worse, profit margins are shrinking, because of the surging prices of fertiliser and energy. These are farmers’ main costs and both markets are disrupted by sanctions and the scramble for natural gas. If farmers cut back on fertiliser, global yields will be lower at just the wrong time. The response by worried politicians could make a bad situation worse. Since the war started, 23 countries from Kazakhstan to Kuwait have declared severe restrictions on food exports that cover 10% of globally traded calories. More than one-fifth of all fertiliser exports are restricted. If trade stops, famine will ensue.The scene is set for a blame game, in which the West condemns Mr Putin for his invasion and Russia decries Western sanctions. In truth the disruptions are primarily the result of Mr Putin’s invasion and some sanctions have exacerbated them. The argument could easily become an excuse for inaction. Meanwhile many people will be going hungry and some will die. Instead states need to act together, starting by keeping markets open. This week Indonesia, source of 60% of the world’s palm oil, lifted a temporary ban on exports. Europe should help Ukraine ship its grain via rail and road to ports in Romania or the Baltics, though even the most optimistic forecasts say that just 20% of the harvest could get out that way. Importing countries need support, too, so they do not end up being capsized by enormous bills. Emergency supplies of grain should go only to the very poorest. For others, import financing on favourable terms, perhaps provided through the imf, would allow donors’ dollars to go further. Debt relief may also help to free up vital resources.There is scope for substitution. About 10% of all grains are used to make biofuel; and 18% of vegetable oils go to biodiesel. Finland and Croatia have weakened mandates that require petrol to include fuel from crops. Others should follow their lead. An enormous amount of grain is used to feed animals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, grain accounts for 13% of cattle dry feed. In 2021 China imported 28m tonnes of corn to feed its pigs, more than Ukraine exports in a year.Immediate relief would come from breaking the Black Sea blockade. Roughly 25m tonnes of corn and wheat, equivalent to the annual consumption of all of the world’s least developed economies, is trapped in Ukraine. Three countries must be brought onside: Russia needs to allow Ukrainian shipping; Ukraine has to de-mine the approach to Odessa; and Turkey needs to let naval escorts through the Bosporus. That will not be easy. Russia, struggling on the battlefield, is trying to strangle Ukraine’s economy. Ukraine is reluctant to clear its mines. Persuading them to relent will be a task for countries, including India and China, that have sat out the war. Convoys may require armed escorts endorsed by a broad coalition.

67,Making sense of Vladimir Putin’s war,,23/12/22,"WHEN THE second battle for El Alamein in Egypt concluded in November 1942, Winston Churchill reflected on the British victory. “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end,” he warned, memorably. “But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its 11th month, it is reaching the same inflection point. It has been a story of Russian hubris, human suffering and, above all, Ukrainian defiance. In April 2021 Russia began massing an unusual number of forces on the border with Ukraine. In retrospect, that was a dry run for what would follow. In July that year Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, published a rambling essay which questioned Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state. After Russia concluded its massive Zapad military exercise in western Russia and Belarus in September, it left much of the kit behind—another warning sign.By October, American intelligence had acquired Russia’s war plans. The next month Bill Burns, the CIA director, was sent to Moscow to warn Mr Putin off. But the build-up continued, tracked in unprecedented detail by open-source intelligence such as commercial satellite imagery. In January, as Russia held sham talks with America and NATO while denying it was planning an invasion, The Economist warned that war was looming. “For Mr Putin, the gamble may be worth it,” we wrote. “Better to start a war now, despite the attendant costs, than risk a Ukraine bristling with foreign troops in a decade.” The invasion finally came at dawn on February 24th, delayed by a week or so from its planned date because of jitters in Moscow over weather and other matters. Russian armies poured into Ukraine from the north, east and south, initiating the biggest war in Europe since 1945. Most officials, including Ukrainian ones, expected that Russia would quickly overwhelm its smaller neighbour. That did not happen. Though Russia’s war plans had been exposed—on February 17th British defence intelligence published an accurate map of the likely axes of invasion—its military units did not receive orders until 24 hours before the war, according to a recent study by RUSI, a think-tank. Troops lacked ammunition, food, fuel and maps. Many wandered into Ukrainian towns without their weapons loaded. When they asked Ukrainian civilians where they were, their positions were promptly reported. This was, in part, a failure of intelligence. Russia’s vaunted spies made a series of blunders. Many spoke only to those Ukrainians who agreed that the country was ripe for conquest and would fall without serious fighting. Contradictory intelligence—and there was much of it—was not passed up the chain. Spy agencies in authoritarian countries often tell their bosses what they want to hear.The invasion also revealed a deeper rot in Russia’s armed forces, including endemic corruption and a lack of training. When Valery Gerasimov, the chief of general staff, met his British counterpart in February, he claimed that Russia had reached conventional military parity with America’s armed forces. That claim has been exposed as hollow. Russia’s air force struggled against Ukraine’s aged but agile air defences, and its tanks were used ineptly. Cyber forces were unprepared for a long campaign. Nevertheless, the opening stage of the war was a closer-run thing than many assumed at the time. Doubting that Russia would invade, Ukraine’s civilian leaders were not fully prepared themselves, despite extensive warnings from America and Britain. The majority of Ukraine’s regular forces were pinned down in the eastern Donbas region, after anticipating that any attack would probably come only there. Russian jets and tanks were superior to Ukrainian ones. Russia’s performance in the south was better. Its forces there formed effective “storm groups” of armour and infantry, backed by Chechen fighters, notes RUSI. But even then Mariupol, a port city, fell only in May, after months of brutal aerial bombardment.In fact, Russian units proved unable to adapt or to recover from their heavy initial casualties. On March 2nd they took Kherson, capital of the province of the same name, but found themselves stymied in the suburbs of Kyiv, repelled from Kharkiv in the east and halted en route to Odessa at the southern city of Mykolaiv. In late March the Kremlin thus looked reality in the eye and announced that it would “drastically reduce” operations in the north to focus on Donbas.By the first week of April Russia’s ignominious retreat from the capital was largely complete. Ukraine had won the battle of Kyiv, despite a twelve-to-one disadvantage in troop numbers at the outset. As Russian troops withdrew, they left in their wake evidence of mass killings and other war crimes in towns like Bucha, in effect ending any prospect for successful peace talks.The second phase of the war had some successes for Russia. It used its advantage in artillery ammunition to outgun Ukraine in the east, slowly seizing the entirety of Luhansk province. Russian artillery in Donbas fired around 20,000 rounds per day, notes RUSI, with a peak rate of 32,000 rounds on some days—three to five times the Ukrainian rate. “We are inferior in terms of equipment and therefore we are not capable of advancing,” lamented Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, in early June. But his forces found creative ways to hit back. In April Ukraine mounted daring cross-border helicopter raids on the Russian city of Belgorod and then sank the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet—one of the biggest naval losses for any country since the Falklands war of 1982. Ukraine also dominated the information war in the West. In August we described the antics of the North Atlantic Fellas Organisation (NAFO), a virtual pro-Ukraine army whose members take the guise of shiba inu dogs and fight Russian propagandists with memes.The third phase of the war began in the summer, as Ukraine switched to the offensive. In June it received the first HIMARS rocket launchers from America, longer-range and more precise than anything in the Russian arsenal. It began so-called deep strikes on ammunition depots, command posts and barracks far behind the frontlines. It also targeted bridges over the Dnieper river, cutting off Russian forces in Kherson city. A formal offensive there in August made slow progress. But a surprise attack in Kharkiv the next month turned into a rout, liberating vast swathes of territory. As Ukrainian offensives met with success, Russia scrambled to adjust. On September 21st Mr Putin announced a partial mobilisation of Russian men, a process that yielded over 100,000 in less than two months. In October Mr Putin appointed a new commander, General Sergei Surovikin, who began a campaign of large-scale drone and missile strikes against Ukraine’s infrastructure. A month later he withdrew Russian troops from the right bank of Kherson as part of a wider shift to the defensive. Russia remains on the offensive in Bakhmut, a small town in Donetsk that has turned into a test for the Wagner Group, a Kremlin-backed mercenary outfit, and Ukraine continues to probe Russian lines in places. But the weather is already affecting the war. Muddy ground will soon freeze, allowing heavy vehicles to move around again, but the sub-zero temperatures will make it harder for soldiers to survive in the field. “We’re seeing a kind of a reduced tempo already of the conflict,” noted Avril Haines, America’s director of national intelligence, on December 3rd, “and we expect that’s likely to be what we see in the coming months.” Both sides are now rearming for offensives, probably in 2023, with Ukraine raising a new army corps and Russia using mobilised men to train up fresh units.The war has thrown up a number of important lessons. Despite the increasing importance of technology, mass still matters. Reserves of manpower, weaponry and ammunition are vital as a war drags on. Intelligence is key: the decision to publicise Russia’s invasion plans undercut the Kremlin’s narrative and prevented it from using its planned pretext for war. Urban warfare has figured prominently in places like Kyiv, Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Bakhmut.Perhaps the biggest lesson of all is simply that war is back. “Developed countries have managed to avoid major conflicts with one another now for 75 years,” wrote John Mueller, a political scientist, in July 2021, the month that Mr Putin put his ravings about Ukraine to paper. It was “perhaps the longest such hiatus in history”. The question is whether Mr Putin’s delusions will shatter the long peace, or serve as a warning to others. ■The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
68,Odessa strives for normality despite Russia’s war,,07/05/22,"THE SUN is shining, the fountains are playing and Odessans are enjoying simple pleasures—most of all that of seeing their city come back to life. Primorsky (“Seaside”) Boulevard is still cordoned off, and the statue of the Duc de Richelieu, the city’s early-19th-century governor, is covered in sandbags. But the tank traps have been moved to the outskirts, where the lines of defence now lie.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The actual fighting has moved to Mykolaiv, some 130km away. Russian shelling left that city’s residents without water, so Odessans are sending them bottled water and food. In Odessa the main threat now comes from the occasional Russian missile. Even when air-raid sirens wail, people carry on with their lives.In the morning they flock to Privoz, Odessa’s biggest market and the source of much folklore. The fish rows are emptier than usual, as mines have barred fishing in the Black Sea, and tomatoes are twice as expensive as before the war, but nobody is complaining. In the evening, in the city gardens, a local crooner sings romantic songs in Ukrainian to people on benches and in cafés. As 10pm approaches, the streets empty and men with guns come out to enforce the curfew.Odessa, a cosmopolitan port city of traders, adventurers, writers, gangsters and romantics, of multiple ethnicities, languages and cultures, is known for storytelling. And the story it tells today is of life winning over war. Odessans are proud that the most popular meme of this war was coined off their coast, on Snake Island, where Ukrainian border guards told a Russian warship “Go fuck yourself.” They are even prouder that on April 14th their army sank the Moskva, Russia’s Black Sea flagship. Four days later they queued to buy new postage stamps marking the meme.Since then there have been no Russian ships on the horizon. At Arcadia beach, people are jogging and cafés are reopening. But the beaches are still mined, and only the bravest venture into the water. More important, Odessa’s economic heart, the port which carries Ukraine’s grain to the world, is blockaded.Russia still yearns to conquer Odessa, once a jewel of the Russian empire. But according to Gennadiy Trukhanov, the city’s mayor, they want it “intact and beautiful”, so they are unlikely to bomb its historic centre. Their plan is to cut it off from the rest of Ukraine by advancing from Mykolaiv to Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist region of Moldova.Russia once hoped Odessa would greet its soldiers with flowers, counting perhaps on Mr Trukhanov’s many ties to Russia. A former Soviet officer, he was one of the first to warn that Russia might invade, and prepared by revamping bomb shelters. Russian is the lingua franca in this city of 130 nationalities, but that does not make it pro-Russian, Mr Trukhanov says. He is disgusted by the Russian army’s behaviour: “These are not military warriors, they are murderers, driven only by fear of what will happen to them if they don’t follow orders—and by money.”Mr Trukhanov’s anger is all the greater because he considers the war a personal betrayal. So do most Odessans, for whom Russia’s language, history and culture are a part of their city. “Russian soldiers and officers must see that this is not a military operation, but a cynical, murderous, occupational war of punishment, with all the signs of fascism and Nazism.”Where Russia hoped Odessa might be a weak link in Ukraine’s defence, it has proved a bastion, an emblem of a nation that draws its strength from diversity, free enterprise and freedom. While soldiers dig trenches and fortify defences, the city is stockpiling enough food, water and medicine for two months. Mr Trukhanov is asking the army to de-mine some of the beaches so that people can swim in the summer.It is not just his Soviet military background that equips him for the job. In the 1990s Italian police named Mr Trukhanov as a major player in the Odessan mafia, responsible for training gang members in “hand-to-hand combat and sniper shooting with high-precision weapons”. In 2021 he was charged with organised crime in Ukraine, but avoided arrest with a $1.1m bail payment. He makes little distinction between his own businesses and those of the city. (Mr Trukhanov denies all such allegations.) But what seemed an obvious conflict of interest before the war became one of the city’s strengths in defending it against the invasion. Old vendettas have been set aside, at least for the moment.Nika Vikhniansky, a furniture businessman who opposed Mr Trukhanov in elections, is now working side by side with him managing volunteers and co-ordinating humanitarian aid. “The city council told us we were far more efficient than they are,” he explains. Mr Vikhniansky’s grandfather was a tank driver who fought the Nazis during the second world war. “Then they were killing us as Jews,” he says. “Now they are killing us as Ukrainians.” ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""How things are done in Odessa""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
69,Ukraine and Russia are both trapped by the war in Donbas,,25/05/17,"ON APRIL 12TH 2014 Igor Girkin, a former Russian military officer also known as “Strelkov” (“Shooter”), sneaked across the border into Ukraine’s Donbas region with a few dozen men and took control of the small town of Sloviansk, igniting Europe’s bloodiest war since the 1990s. To create the impression of strength, Mr Girkin, an aficionado of historical battlefield re-enactments, masqueraded as a member of Russia’s special forces, and had his men drive two armoured personnel carriers around every night to simulate a large build-up. In fact, his army never exceeded 600 men, mainly Cossacks and war-hungry opportunists like himself.Having just lost Crimea and lacking a functioning government or military command after the Maidan revolution, Ukraine was stunned. As Russia massed its forces on the border with Ukraine, most observers (and participants such as Mr Girkin) expected a swift invasion followed by annexation. Instead, the Kremlin created an ersatz civil war, absurdly portraying the Kiev government as a “fascist” regime and the separatists as freedom fighters. As the Ukrainian army moved in to try to retake Donbas, Mr Girkin and his fighters took up positions in a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Sloviansk, using its patients as human shields.Today, the ruined psychiatric hospital, resembling a scene out of the battle of Stalingrad, is a symbol of the madness of an essentially theatrical conflict that has cost 10,000 lives and displaced more than 1.7m people. Yet officially, Russia and Ukraine are not at war. They maintain diplomatic relations and trade with each other. Ukraine has euphemistically designated the conflict zone an area of “anti-terrorist operations” (ATO). Most of the people caught up in the war do not care who started it, or what they call it.“I am against everyone,” says Lyudmila Prikhodko, who lives in a restored building among the hospital’s ruins. (The names of civilians in the conflict zone have been changed.) An engineer, Ms Prikhodko was forced to flee Donetsk after refusing to support the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR). She feels equally alienated from Russia and Ukraine. “DNR treats people like me as enemies. Ukraine sees us as potential separatists.”On paper, there is no border between the two parts of Ukraine. In practice, there are several frontier control points, manned by border guards and customs officials and crossed by those who live in the separatist territories but must work, receive pensions or handle bureaucratic problems on the Ukrainian side. Andrei Borisov, a smuggler who carries food, cigarettes and pesticides from Ukrainian territory across the line of control, says everyone is in on the business: customs officers, local officials and separatists on the other side.During the day, while the Mayorsk crossing is open, things are relatively quiet. When it closes and darkness falls, the two sides start firing mortars at each other, while people living in no-man’s land take shelter in their houses. In the morning they come out to inspect their vegetable plots, dotted with craters, and collect their harvest of potatoes and shrapnel.In nearby Avdiivka, one of the flashpoints a few months ago, the firing is more intense. Four civilians were recently killed. Alexander Samarsky, a commander of the Ukrainian army’s 72nd Brigade, says the main purpose of this seemingly pointless pounding is the need for the separatists to boost morale and keep soldiers active and disciplined. The same applies to his troops, who have been stationed here without rotation for over seven months. The army is in much better shape than it was three years ago, but drinking and drugs have become enough of a problem for Kiev to send in the national guard, a militarised police force. Without being asked, two national guardsmen take out a smartphone and display a video of drunken army officers having their bootleg liquor and bags of white powder confiscated.The two guardsmen’s own story is compelling. Three years ago, at the Maidan demonstration, they were on opposite sides of the barricade: one, a militarised police officer from Kharkiv, was called in to defend the presidential administration; the other, from Kiev, was a student protester. Today they man one post. Yet such solidarity is uncommon among civilians. Most of the local population in Avdiivka, according to Mr Samarsky, are not on his side. Russian television continues to broadcast there, and absurdly, despite the daily shelling, most of the locals blame Ukraine rather than Russia for their misery.Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, seems more worried about losing the loyalty of pro-Ukrainian fighters than he is about winning hearts and minds in the east. Instead of campaigning for the support of local Russian-speakers, the government is imposing quotas on the use of Russian on Ukrainian channels and banning the import of Russian-language books. Mr Poroshenko’s position may be weaker than it seems. In February, a small group of Ukrainian irregulars and volunteers blocked railway traffic across the line of control, halting freight between the separatist territories and the rest of Ukraine. Mr Poroshenko opposed the blockade, but its slogan, “No trade in blood”, caught on. Support for the blockade soared from 7% to over 50%, according to polls.Unable to beat them, the government joined them, imposing a trade and energy blockade on the occupied territories. This disturbed the situation in Donetsk. The separatists responded by seizing control of all of the coal mines and steel and chemical plants owned by Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine’s richest oligarch. Mr Akhmetov was not only the biggest employer in the occupied territories but also their greatest benefactor, providing up to 400,000 humanitarian food parcels per month to the elderly and those in need. The parcels have now been stopped by the separatists, and Mr Akhmetov’s 56,000 well-paid miners and workers have lost their income.When Mr Akhmetov’s workers attempted to protest, they were met with a mixture of threats and bribes by the separatists and their Russian backers. The miners’ protests would have destroyed the illusion the Russians have tried to create of a model Soviet-era proletarian city. The half-empty city has been kept spotless, the lawns mowed and pavements swept clean. Oksana Mironova, who lives in Donetsk and manages a medium-sized business on the Ukrainian side, says the separatists are trying to introduce the symbols and attributes of a state and create an impression of permanence. Yet it remains a gangster-run territory: “They put on lipstick but forgot to wash their necks.”Unable to offer much of a future, the separatists are cultivating the symbols of the Soviet past. On May 11th, they marked the third anniversary of their “republic” with a Soviet-style march. A voice boomed from loudspeakers: “We greet this day with joy and pride for a glorious past and in confidence for a peaceful and happy future.” Workers with balloons and Soviet flags marched in columns along Lenin Prospect. Yet keeping up a Soviet veneer may not be easy without jobs, particularly as industrial production plummets.However disillusioned most people in Donetsk feel with the “Russian spring”, few believe that the territory could ever be reincorporated into Ukraine. But it is not just Ukraine and Russia that have been engaged in a game of make-believe. So has the West, whose leaders continue to endorse the Minsk-2 ceasefire agreement, while privately admitting that it is dead.From the time Minsk-2 was signed two years ago, it was designed to mask an effective defeat of the Ukrainian army by Russian forces. The agreement calls for Russia to return control over its border and over the separatist territories to Ukraine, something it will never do. Ukraine, meanwhile, lacks the military power or Western support to take it by force. America has refused to arm Ukraine with lethal weapons, let alone fight on its side. Some Western politicians argue that it would be more honest and productive to pronounce Minsk-2 dead and enforce the current line of division between the separatists and the rest of Ukraine with an armed peacekeeping force. Ukraine, the argument goes, would lose only a swatch of land which it does not control anyway. And it would prevent the rest of the country from being frozen in a permanent state of war.The problem is that too many parties in this conflict have an interest in keeping up the charade. This includes both Mr Poroshenko and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Both have rejected any talk of changing the Minsk-2 agreement, as this would undermine their credibility. Yet neither is interested in taking formal responsibility for Donbas. Mr Poroshenko’s legitimacy rests almost entirely on the fight against Russia, and he has no interest in letting Donbas vote in the presidental elections in 2019. The Kremlin does not want either to pay for Donbas or to limit its options in meddling in the rest of Ukraine.Yet leaving things as they are does not mean they will stay this way. As Mr Girkin said recently: “sooner or later [Russia] will have to face either a victory or a defeat. A military confrontation is inevitable.” His ideal outcome would be a resurrection of Novorossiya, the historic Russian term for the eastern parts of Ukraine, as part of a new state comprising Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This may seem like a delusion. But then so did his first raid on the hospital in Sloviansk three years ago.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Theatre of war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
70,Why is Russia setting up detention centres in Ukraine?,,30/04/22,"SINCE RUSSIA’S war of aggression in Ukraine began, hundreds of thousands of people have been forcibly deported to Russia by occupying forces. The exact number is unclear: on April 21st Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, put the figure at half a million. On April 30th Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that more than 1m people had been “evacuated”. Many passed through Russian “filtration camps” on their way out of Ukraine. What are these detention centres?The concept of fil’tratsiia or filtration emerged at the end of the second world war, as the Soviet Union and other Allied forces liberated prisoners from the Nazis. Some 2.4m Soviet citizens—mostly soldiers—survived concentration camps. But their release placed them in the cross-hairs of military commissars, who worried that those who had been taken prisoner or displaced by war had been exposed to liberal influences abroad. Forced repatriation resulted in an estimated 5m people being sent back to the Soviet Union. To counter anti-Soviet ideology, more than 4m of them were subjected to filtration, undergoing rigorous screening, interrogation and incarceration in holding stations set up by the secret police and intelligence agencies. Some 280,000 ended up in gulags. Five decades later, filtration reappeared in Chechnya, a predominantly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus. During the two wars of the 1990s Russian authorities arbitrarily detained civilians at checkpoints, sending thousands to camps in an effort to stamp out Chechen separatism, adherents of which the Kremlin demonised as terrorists and bandits. Widespread human-rights abuses including rape, extortion, beatings and torture were documented by human-rights groups. In many cases, detainees simply disappeared.There are disturbing parallels in Ukraine. Before Russia’s invasion, American officials said that Russian forces were creating lists of people to be killed or sent to camps if Russia occupied parts of the country. Likely targets included Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile, anti-corruption activists, members of religious and ethnic minorities and LGBT people. A satellite image captured in March by Maxar Technologies, an American firm, showed Russian-backed forces had begun building a temporary camp of regimented blue-and-white tents in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne near the port-city of Mariupol, in south-eastern Ukraine. According to witnesses, Ukrainians sent there were photographed and forced to turn over their mobile phones and identity documents before being interrogated and deported to Russia. The Kremlin describes these people as “refugees”. Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, claims that 5,000 civilians were screened at Bezimenne to prevent “Ukrainian nationalists from infiltrating Russia”. But escapers tell a different story, comparing conditions to those of a ghetto or concentration camp. They claim to have witnessed torture and killings carried out by Russian security services to weed out “Ukrainian Nazis”. According to the UN, the deportation or transfer of people from an occupied territory constitutes a war crime. Russia insists that the relocation of civilians by its armed forces is benign and voluntary. But filtration camps appear to be a tool of war, used to erase Ukrainian identity.

71,Putin’s war on the West,,12/02/15,"HE IS ridiculed for his mendacity and ostracised by his peers. He presides over a free-falling currency and a rapidly shrinking economy. International sanctions stop his kleptocratic friends from holidaying in their ill-gotten Mediterranean villas. Judged against the objectives Vladimir Putin purported to set on inheriting Russia’s presidency 15 years ago—prosperity, the rule of law, westward integration—regarding him as a success might seem bleakly comical.But those are no longer his goals, if they ever really were. Look at the world from his perspective, and Mr Putin is winning. For all his enemies’ machinations, he remains the Kremlin’s undisputed master. He has a throttlehold on Ukraine, a grip this week’s brittle agreement in Minsk has not eased. Domesticating Ukraine through his routine tactics of threats and bribery was his first preference, but the invasion has had side benefits. It has demonstrated the costs of insubordination to Russians; and, since he thinks Ukraine’s government is merely a puppet of the West (the supposed will of its people being, to his ultracynical mind, merely a cover for Western intrigues), the conflict has usefully shown who is boss in Russia’s backyard. Best of all, it has sown discord among Mr Putin’s adversaries: among Europeans, and between them and America.His overarching aim is to divide and neuter that alliance, fracture its collective approach to security, and resist and roll back its advances. From his tantrums over the Middle East to his invasion of Georgia and multiple misadventures in Ukraine, Mr Putin has sometimes seemed to stumble into accidental disputes with the West, driven by a paranoid fear of encirclement. In hindsight it seems that, given his outlook, confrontation may have been inevitable. Either way, the contest he insists on can no longer be dodged. It did not begin in poor Ukraine and will not end there. Prevailing will require far more resolve than Western leaders have so far mustered.Last year Mr Putin lopped off Crimea, redrawing Europe’s map by force. The war he hallucinated into reality in eastern Ukraine has killed thousands. Even if the ceasefire scheduled for February 15th holds (unlikely, on past form), he seems certain to get what he wants there: a wretched little quasi-state in the Donbas, which he can use to stall and warp Ukraine’s development. Yet these incursions are only his latest bid to bludgeon former Soviet states into submission, whether through energy blackmail, trade embargoes or war. For Mr Putin the only good neighbour is a weak one; vassals are better than allies. Only the wilfully blind would think his revanchism has been sated. Sooner or later it may encompass the Baltic states—members of both the European Union and NATO, and home to Russian minorities of the kind he pledges to “protect”.The EU and NATO are Mr Putin’s ultimate targets. To him, Western institutions and values are more threatening than armies. He wants to halt their spread, corrode them from within and, at least on the West’s fragile periphery, supplant them with his own model of governance. In that model, nation-states trump alliances, states are dominated by elites, and those elites can be bought. Here, too, he has enjoyed some success. From France to Greece to Hungary he is cultivating parties on Europe’s far right and left: anyone who might lobby for Russian interests in the EU, or even help to prise the union apart (see article). The biggest target is NATO’s commitment to mutual self-defence. Discredit that—by, for example, staging a pro-Russian uprising in Estonia or Latvia, which other NATO members decline to help quell—and the alliance crumbles.Mr Putin’s stranglehold on his own country means he has time and freedom for this campaign. As he has amply demonstrated, he has no qualms about sacrificing Russians’ well-being to satisfy his coterie’s greed or to further his geopolitical schemes. He persecutes those who protest. And in the echo chamber his propaganda creates, the nationalism he peddles as a consolation for domestic woes is flourishing.The first task for the West is to recognise the problem. Barack Obama has blithely regarded Russia as an awkward regional power, prone to post-imperial spasms but essentially declining. Historians will be amazed that, with Ukraine aflame, the West was still debating whether to eject Russia from the G8. To paraphrase Trotsky, Western leaders may not have been interested in Mr Putin, but Mr Putin was interested in them.The next step is to craft a response as supple as the onslaught. Part of the trouble is that Mr Putin plays by different rules; indeed, for him, there are no inviolable rules, nor universal values, nor even cast-iron facts (such as who shot down flight MH17). There are only interests. His Russia has graduated from harassing ambassadors and assassinating critics to invasions. This is one of his assets: a readiness to stoop to methods the West cannot emulate without sullying itself.The current version of this quandary is whether, if the latest ceasefire fails, to arm Ukraine. Proponents think defensive weapons would inflict a cost on Mr Putin for fighting on. But anyone who doubts his tolerance of mass casualties should recall his war in Chechnya. If arms really are to deter him, the West must be united and ready to match his inevitable escalation with still more powerful weapons (along, eventually, with personnel to operate them). Yet the alliance is split over the idea. Mr Putin portrays the war as a Western provocation: arming Ukraine would turn that from fantasy to something like fact, while letting him expose the limits of Western unity and its lack of resolve—prizes he cherishes. If fresh Russian aggression galvanises the alliance, arming Ukraine will become a more potent threat. Until that point, it would backfire.A better strategy is to eschew his methods and rely on an asset that he, in turn, cannot match: a way of life that people covet. If that seems wishy-washy beside his tanks, remember that the crisis began with Ukrainians’ desire to tilt towards the EU—and Mr Putin’s determination to stop them. Better than arms, the West must urgently give Ukraine as much aid as it needs to build a state and realise that dream (and as much advice as it takes to ensure the cash is not misspent or stolen). The IMF deal announced on February 12th should be only a start. Mr Putin wants Ukraine to be a lesson in the perils of leaning West. It should instead be an exemplar of the rewards.Just as urgently, those former Soviet countries that have joined Western institutions must be buttressed and reassured. If the case for sending arms to the Donbas is doubtful, that for basing NATO troops in the Baltics is overwhelming, however loudly Mr Putin squeals. Western leaders must make it clear, to him and their own people, that they will defend their allies, and the alliance—even if the struggle is covert and murky.And it isn’t only its allies who appreciate the West’s virtues. So do many Russians, including shameless Putinists who denounce the West’s decadence but exploit its schools and stockmarkets. It is long past time for every Russian parliamentarian and senior official to join the sanctions list. Far from being relaxed as, after Minsk, fellow-travellers may suggest, sanctions must be tightened—and sanctions-busting curtailed (see article). In the end, they will prove a stronger lever than weapons.At the same time, the West should use every available means to help ordinary Russians, including Russian-sympathisers in the Baltics and Ukraine, learn the bloody, venal truth about Mr Putin. It should let them know that Russia, a great nation dragged down a terrible path, will be embraced when it has rulers who treat the world, and their own people, with respect not contempt, however long that takes.This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline ""Putin’s war on the West""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The country needs a new political settlement that diminishes the power of extremistsPrivate credit, not buy-outs, is stealing the limelightThe greenback is still king.

72,“At what age do they take people to Ukraine?”: war catches up with the Russian elite,,07/11/22,"By AnonymousIn late September, soon after Vladimir Putin announced that there would be nationwide conscription in Russia, I overheard my 14-year-old student ask his father about it. “At what age do they take people to Ukraine?” the boy said, anxiously. His father wrapped him in a hug, reassuring him that he was too young. In all the months I’d been the family’s live-in tutor, I’d never seen my boss display so much affection to his children.The boy used to be a lot more gung-ho. When the “special military operation” in Ukraine first started in February he would sternly repeat the government line to me (Russia was strong and good, Ukraine wasn’t a real country). At school he and his friends would tell patriotic jokes. Recently, though, I’d noticed that the memes he forwarded weren’t all pro-Russian – some had even come from the Ukrainian side. The other day he made me watch a TikTok of Ukrainian soldiers imitating characters from a popular video game, followed by more clips of him and his friends trying to recreate their moves. I asked him if they realised it was Ukrainian soldiers they were emulating. He shrugged. A more serious message seems to be cutting through the jumble of social-media posts. When we were going through his homework shortly after the hug I witnessed, my student abruptly said: “I think Russia is losing the war.” I asked why he thought that. “That’s just what I heard. I think nobody wants to fight there.” We moved on, but the gravity of what he’d said lingered. This teenager is not the only one whose patriotic certainty has faded since the war’s early days. A giant “Z” – the symbol of support for Putin’s invasion – that someone had painted across the front of a building in the city has now gone. People make snide remarks about Russia’s progress on the battlefield, and they go unchallenged. The draft has changed the atmosphere.Men are becoming less visible in Russia: hundreds of thousands have been conscripted and many more are fleeing conscription. At a café I recently overheard a table of women gossiping about their boyfriends in Turkey. The army isn’t held in much esteem these days (“Russian soldiers are supposed to be the second-best in the world but I think my husband is only third or fourth,” runs one joke) so little shame is attached to draft-dodging.“I think Russia is losing the war. That’s what I heard. I think nobody wants to fight there”Some women I know whose partners have left the country are discovering new reserves of toughness. One friend is doing two jobs so that she can send money to her boyfriend, who is lying low in Turkey without an income. She’s so relieved he’s safe from the draft that she doesn’t even seem to register how tired she is. Another is doing the same for her boyfriend. “He supported me for ten years, now it’s my turn,” she says.Others left behind are distraught. One friend called me in tears to say her half-brother had received his summons and was going to Ukraine at the end of October. “He is terrified. He cried with my father when he got the letter. He is too young,” she said. She is convinced he is going to die.I don’t know any men who have gone to fight, but my boss’s bodyguard, a fit man in his early 30s, is clearly expecting the summons. In the days following the announcement he kept going off to take phone calls in private. We recently found ourselves alone together and I asked him what he was planning to do. “I am stuck here. We don’t speak English,” he said. “My job here is great. In Turkey, what can I do?” He hopes he will at least have a chance to get his wife pregnant before he’s called up.Men are becoming less visible in Russia: hundreds of thousands have been conscripted and many more are fleeing conscriptionAs an obviously foreign man who likes going out in the evening, I’m used to being on the receiving end of drunken abuse in Russia. Mostly I find it funny. “Why are you here? All your men are women and all your women are men. We don’t have that here,” ranted one acquaintance in 2018. But the fight seems even to have gone out of the drunks, now. I recently conducted a phone call in English in a local bar. When I hung up a surly man who was drinking alone asked me if Britain had ever put people through a draft. I said I didn’t think it had happened since the second world war. He nodded. “Good. We mustn’t live like this. Why have you stayed? You do not have to stay like I do.” It was a valid point. I have considered Russia my home for most of the past decade. Now it is in the midst of something I cannot comprehend and am not part of. Four days later I packed my bags and left. ■The writer was recently based in Russia.

73,A looming Russian offensive,,15/12/22,"Russia is MASSING men and arms for a new offensive. As soon as January, but more likely in the spring, it could launch a big attack from Donbas in the east, from the south or even from Belarus, a puppet state in the north. Russian troops will aim to drive back Ukrainian forces and could even stage a second attempt to take Kyiv, the capital. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Those are not our words, but the assessment of the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, General Valery Zaluzhny. In an unprecedented series of briefings within the past fortnight the general, along with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, and General Oleksandr Syrsky, the head of its ground forces, warned us of the critical few months ahead. “The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops,” General Zaluzhny told us. “I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.” Western sources say that Russia’s commander, General Sergey Surovikin, has always seen this as a multi-year conflict.This is not the view outside Ukraine. In the freezing mud, the conflict is thought to be deadlocked. There has been almost no movement for a month along the 1,000km or so of battlefront. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s most senior officer, this week said that, right now, a shortage of artillery shells means Russia’s scope for ground operations is “rapidly diminishing”.The appearance of stalemate is feeding new interest in peace talks. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, America’s Joe Biden and (for very different reasons) the Russian aggressor, Vladimir Putin, have all in recent days talked about a diplomatic solution. Many in the West, appalled at the suffering, and, more selfishly, wearying of high energy prices, would welcome this. But Ukraine’s commanders argue that it should not happen too soon, and they are right. If Ukraine sought to stop the war today, freezing the battle lines where they are, the Russians could prepare better for the next attack. Mr Putin’s generals have been pushing on with their programme of training and deploying newly mobilised troops and retooling industry to help the war effort—including, say Ukrainian commanders, by producing artillery shells. A freeze would repeat the mistake of the three years leading up to the invasion on February 24th 2022. In that time Mr Putin talked endlessly to the West’s leaders, who indulged him, while all the while readying his armies for invasion. The West’s highest responsibility is to ensure that any Russian counter-offensive fails. For that, the supply of weapons must increase, and fast. Ukraine has used HIMARS, a rocket system the Americans have been supplying since June, to devastating effect against Russian ammunition dumps and command-and-control centres, allowing the rapid advance first in the north-east and then in the south. But Russia has moved many such targets back out of range of Ukraine’s HIMARS batteries. So Ukraine needs more powerful ordnance, like the ATACMS missiles that could hit targets at least twice as far away. And it needs lots of them, as well as regular ammunition and artillery of all kinds; plus tanks and helicopters and much else, too.More on the growing threat to Ukraine• Ukraine’s top soldier runs a different kind of army from Russia’s• Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief-of-staff on how to end war in Ukraine• Volodymyr Zelensky and his generals talk to The Economist• An interview with Volodymyr Zelensky, president of UkraineUkraine also needs help repelling Russian attacks on civilian electrical, water and heating systems. These are aimed at wrecking Ukraine’s economy as well as battering the morale of Ukrainian troops on the front line, who are worried about their families back home. As General Zaluzhny explains, Ukraine is running low on stocks of ammunition for its existing defence systems (mostly Soviet-era anti-aircraft kit being repurposed for use against missiles). It also needs many more, and better, anti-missile defences; the American Patriots that now seem to be forthcoming will be a huge boost, but training soldiers to use them takes time and they should have been supplied months ago.If Ukraine is to emerge from this conflict as a thriving democracy, even air defence will not be enough: it also needs to recapture more territory. Although Russian forces have seized only a small slice of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast this year, that puts them close enough to all of the big Ukrainian-held ports to menace shipping. Apart from limited amounts of grain under a UN deal, Ukraine’s exports are still largely cut off.Taking more territory also helps avoid a frozen conflict by showing that Mr Putin risks losing even the gains he has made. With today’s frontier, Russia has a land-bridge that can resupply annexed Crimea and threaten the south of the country. By contrast, if Ukraine cuts the land-bridge and retakes the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, it can negotiate from strength, putting even Crimea within artillery range. That way it can discredit the idea in Russia that Mr Putin can prevail simply by launching another attack in a few years’ time. Ukraine is still willing to make the sacrifices that fighting on demands. Mr Zelensky told us that “95 or 96% of people want to de-occupy all their territory”, recapturing everything that Russia seized in 2014 as well as what it has taken this year. He argues that Western promises of security guarantees are a poor substitute for his country’s territorial integrity. After all, similar guarantees offered to Ukraine by America and Britain in 1994, when it surrendered the Soviet nuclear weapons on its soil, proved almost worthless 20 years later. Ukraine’s backers will have a slightly different point of view. They believe taking back everything is a maximalist aim that Ukraine will struggle to achieve, not least because it will in places mean freeing people who do not want to be liberated. Mr Putin’s nuclear threats are a reason to ensure that Russia is not victorious, but also a reason to require that Ukraine does not appear to threaten Russia’s recognised borders. Ukraine also needs to understand that the flow of military and financial aid depends on it avoiding internal rivalries that may be emerging, and on ensuring that it curbs long-standing corruption. That said, the entire world—including Russia—would benefit from the failure of the revanchist idea that the old Russian empire can be recreated. If Ukraine is adequately supported, its commanders can push a long way towards the coast, and possibly take back most of what Mr Putin has seized since February. The more territory that Ukraine can recover the greater the chances of its lasting success. ■For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter.This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline ""The winter war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The country needs a new political settlement that diminishes the power of extremistsPrivate credit, not buy-outs, is stealing the limelightThe greenback is still king.

74,The Stans want nothing to do with Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,,26/03/22,"IT WAS ONCE part of the Soviet Union, shares a long border with Russia and counts among its citizens a large ethnic-Russian minority. Russian nationalists lay claim to swathes of its territory and President Vladimir Putin has in the past cast aspersions on its statehood. Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of Russia’s Communist Party, has accused it of Russophobia and the oppression of Russian-speakers. Little wonder then that Kazakhstan is watching Mr Putin’s invasion of Ukraine with apprehension verging on horror.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The war has set nerves jangling across Central Asia. The “Stans”, as the region’s five post-Soviet states are known, are, broadly speaking, allies of Russia. But the aggressive expansionism of their former colonial master is testing that friendship to the limit. None of the countries has condemned the invasion. But nor has any offered public support or succumbed to pressure to follow Mr Putin’s lead and recognise the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. At a vote in the UN General Assembly deploring the invasion, on March 2nd, three abstained and two simply did not show up.Kazakhstan, the biggest and richest of the lot, has long cultivated warm relations with Russia. It is a member of a collective-security treaty with its bigger neighbour, along with a handful of other countries including Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In January, when protests in several cities turned violent and threatened to destabilise the country, Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, invoked the treaty’s mutual-defence clause and asked for help from Mr Putin, who duly delivered. But the country also enjoys good relations with the West and has no desire to join Russia as an international pariah. Mr Tokayev has said that his priority is to safeguard Kazakhstan’s “security, sovereignty, territorial integrity”. He is the only Central Asian leader to have spoken to Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, since the invasion began. (He has regular chats with Mr Putin.) He has offered to mediate.Most countries are treading a fine line. Authorities in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, have allowed anti-war protests—though only once—and Kazakh police have fined drivers displaying the letter Z, a symbol of Mr Putin’s invasion. Yet two bloggers known for anti-Russian rhetoric have been jailed, too. Uzbekistan has supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and declined to recognise the breakaway republics. But it has also leant on journalists who are noisily sympathetic to Ukraine.Kyrgyzstan, which hosts a Russian military base, has come closest to offering (muted) support for Russia. Mr Putin’s recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk may have been “a necessary measure to protect the civilian population”, mused Sadyr Japarov, the president, on Facebook. But that was before the invasion. Since then his public stance has been one of neutrality. Uppermost in his mind may be the position of millions of Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia. That is also a concern for remittance-dependent Tajikistan, which has maintained a studied silence. So has isolationist Turkmenistan, which barely acknowledges what is happening in the outside world and is in any case busy establishing a political dynasty as Serdar Berdymukhamedov, its new president, assumes power from his father, Gurbanguly.Whatever their leaders’ diplomatic manoeuvres, it will be hard for the Stans to avoid the economic fallout. The rouble’s collapse has dragged down their currencies. The Kyrgyzstani som has plunged by 15% since the invasion started and the Kazakhstani tenge by 14%. In part, that is because remittances from Russia are likely to slump, too: by a third in Kyrgyzstan and a fifth in Tajikistan, reckons the World Bank. That will hurt. Remittances are worth nearly a third of GDP in Kyrgyzstan and over a quarter of GDP in Tajikistan.Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are energy-rich and may hope to cash in on buoyant oil and gas prices. But even that can be held hostage. Russia says a pipeline, which crosses its territory to the Black Sea and carries most Kazakh oil, may close for repairs for two months. The move is seen by many as a response to sanctions, with Kazakhstan as collateral damage. “There is this famous saying that if Russia sneezes, Kazakhstan gets a cold,” says a senior Kazakh official. “This will be not a sneeze but perhaps pneumonia, and we will get covid or something.” ■This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline ""Silent Stans""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents For half of Afghans the mullahs’ regime is less bad than fearedThe South-East Asian Games will include obstacle racing and jet skiingHas the movement for a Sikh homeland of Khalistan been rekindled?"
75,The conflict in Ukraine risks inflaming the Sino-American rivalry,,20/02/23,"THE SYMBOLISM could not have been clearer. As America and China drift towards a new cold war, the conflict in Ukraine has increasingly resembled a proxy conflict between the two powers and their rival ideological systems. So when China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi (pictured), travelled to Russia on February 20th, it was only fitting that President Joe Biden should turn up in Kyiv on the same day. China, which dislikes instability, probably did not welcome Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine, but it has sought to make the best of the war, manoeuvring to undermine the unity of Western countries. Mr Biden’s trip, planned in secret, was designed to demonstrate Western resolve.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.It all comes amid a flurry of Chinese diplomacy surrounding the one-year anniversary of the war. On February 18th, at the Munich Security Conference, Mr Wang announced that China would offer a proposal to stop the fighting. Days later his government re-released its “Global Security Initiative”, nearly 3,500 words of Communist Party-speak filled with calls to respect countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to give a “peace speech” on February 24th, the date of Vladimir Putin’s invasion.These efforts ring hollow to American and European officials. Just weeks before Mr Putin launched his invasion, Mr Xi agreed to a “no-limits” partnership with Russia. While in Moscow, Mr Wang said the relationship remained “rock solid”. China claims to be neutral in the war, but it is a pro-Russian pseudo-neutrality. Officials in Beijing have spent a year promoting Kremlin talking-points. China accuses America of prolonging the fighting in order to boost the profits of its arms dealers. Chinese firms have supplied non-lethal aid to Russia, according to American officials. Now China is considering sending weapons and ammunition to Mr Putin’s regime, warned Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, in Munich.Relations between America and China were already at a low point. Each side has come to believe that the other is bent on doing it down. Earlier this month an attempt to lower tensions with a visit to Beijing by Mr Blinken was derailed by a different incursion, that of a Chinese balloon into American airspace. Claiming China was spying, the Americans shot the inflatable down on February 4th. A subsequent discussion between Mr Blinken and Mr Wang in Munich was described as confrontational. America claims Chinese balloons have intruded into the airspace of more than 40 countries across five continents. But Mr Wang insisted that the balloon over America was for research purposes, and called the Biden administration’s response “absurd and hysterical”.The stakes of that squabble seem small compared with what is on the line in Ukraine. China does not care who controls this or that bit of territory. Its national interests lie in discrediting American-led defence alliances and sanctions, because its rulers could one day face a comparable American response over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Mr Xi calls Mr Putin his “best friend” and the pair share a common loathing of Western liberal democracy. But their partnership is based on a cold-eyed calculus of Chinese interests. Russia is making itself useful by tying up America in Europe and creating opportunities for Mr Xi to woo those leaders in the global south who wonder why their countries’ woes do not receive as much attention as those of Ukraine. China also shares Russia’s desire to see a world run not on the basis of what the West calls “universal values”, but of the security interests of big states. Mr Putin may be brutal and his armies dismayingly incompetent, but China believes his invasion advances this worldview.That will inform any peace initiatives put forward by China—and probably doom them. Officials in Beijing like to portray the conflict in Ukraine as “America’s war”, provoked by NATO expansion rather than Russian aggression, and paid for by Europe in the form of higher energy prices, larger armies and the burden of hosting Ukrainian refugees. In this way it has tried to divide America and Europe. In Munich Mr Wang made a pitch to European leaders that China wants to improve relations and play a constructive role in Ukraine. Some might be inclined to take him at his word. But China does not want Mr Putin to pay any price for his invasion, lest that reaffirm the rules-based order that it seeks to break. This does not sit well with European leaders. Even the more cautious among them, such as Emmanuel Macron of France and Olaf Scholz of Germany, told the conference in Munich that Mr Putin cannot walk away from his war rewarded for his aggression. For all that some European leaders grumble about American moves to divide the world into blocs, or fret about isolating China, their view that Mr Putin cannot be seen to win his war puts them in close alignment with the Biden administration—and far from Chinese visions of a peace deal paid for with concessions and security guarantees for Mr Putin. America, for its part, has warned against any ceasefire that would allow Russia to regroup, or that would lock its territorial gains in place. Tactically, the Biden administration is treating China much as it did Russia on the eve of its invasion, by publicising intelligence about its actions, such as Chinese aid to Russia, in the hope of increasing global scrutiny. It appears to be working. Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelensky, told German reporters that “if China allies itself with Russia, there will be a world war.” The European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, said it would be a “red line” for the EU if China sends arms to Russia. Mr Putin says that Mr Xi will visit him in Moscow soon, as relations between their countries reach “new frontiers”. Meanwhile, China is hunkering down. “It is the United States, and not China, that is endlessly shipping weapons to the battlefield,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing. “We urge the United States to earnestly reflect on its own actions and do more to alleviate the situation, promote peace and dialogue, and stop shifting blame and spreading false information.”China wants to be seen as a peace-loving giant that sticks up for forgotten parts of the world and counters Western hectoring. Its argument that states should focus on economic advancement and poverty alleviation rather than civil liberties and human rights gets considerable traction in developing countries. So does China’s portrayal of the war as the latest example of Western-inspired global disorder, sending food and energy prices higher. By offering a peace proposal, no matter how unrealistic, it can pose as a benign world leader with more legitimacy than America. But that message is received differently in the capitals of liberal democracies. Europeans may not like everything about America’s hawkishness on China, but they know a self-serving Chinese argument when they hear one. If China keeps putting out anti-American apologias dressed up in Communist Party jargon about security, peace and development, it will only strengthen fears that a proxy conflict on the blood-soaked plains of Ukraine risks becoming a global confrontation. ■Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.This article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline ""Proxies and peril""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Xi Jinping faults America for any clash of civilisationsA revealing backlash to a new brigade of rural law-enforcement officersSome join a matchmaking live-stream watched by half a million people"
76,Why Russian oil and gas is still flowing through Ukraine,,30/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warIt is, as a Ukrainian energy consultant who prefers to remain nameless put it, “ironic and ridiculous”: in the midst of Russia’s savage war on Ukraine, Russian oil and gas continue to flow through Ukrainian pipelines. Before the war, Europe relied on Russia for 40-45% of its imported gas and about a quarter of its oil. Russia has since tried to bully Europe into dropping economic sanctions by throttling supplies; Europe in turn has almost entirely unplugged itself from Russian energy. But not entirely. The continuing flow is partly a hangover from the old system, and partly thanks to contract law, market reality and political expediency.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Take oil first. Last December Europe banned imports of sea-borne oil from Russia (with a few temporary exceptions). But in a concession to landlocked countries pipelines were exempted. In retaliation, Russia shut off the Northern Druzhba pipeline to Poland and Germany. Yet oil continued to flow via the Southern Druzhba pipeline through Ukraine to refineries in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The latter helps Vladimir Putin maintain his special relationship with Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, who consistently lobbies against EU sanctions. Sanctions bar these three countries from exporting the fuel they make from their Russian crude to others, with one ironic exception: they can send it to Ukraine. Ukrainian refineries, mostly in the country’s war-torn east, have been badly hit. With its ports on the Black Sea blockaded, the only other way Ukraine can get petrol is by truck or train. “In terms of a cynical military strategy, we still need this oil,” says the Ukrainian energy adviser.Russian gas, meanwhile, has never been blocked. Yet as soon as Europe imposed sanctions, Russia began to turn off the taps. Despite the mysterious destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline in September, Russia could have supplied European customers with gas through the Ukrainian network. But when Ukraine shut down a pipeline entry point in occupied territory, Russia refused to pay full transit fees and threatened to cut off supply. Ukraine offered to reroute the gas, but Russia declined. Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state energy firm, has taken Gazprom, the Russian one, to the International Court of Arbitration to resolve the dispute.Mr Putin’s warning that Europe would “freeze” without Russian gas never panned out: the winter was warm, and Europe found other sources. By March Russia’s share of European gas imports had fallen to a bit over 10%. About half of that is liquefied natural gas bought from a private Russian company; another quarter goes through the TurkStream pipeline to southern Europe. The rest goes through Ukraine, mostly to Slovakia and Austria. Analysts expect Russia to wind down this diminishing flow. The contract between Naftogaz and Gazprom runs out at the end of 2024, and it is hard to imagine it being renewed. Ukrainian officials say as long as Europeans are buying Russian gas they will honour their contract to transport it. It would not be in their interests to jeopardise European support by kicking up a fuss. Keeping Ukraine’s network open also helps European clients who are suing Gazprom for cutting them off: otherwise the Russians might argue that the Nord Stream explosion made delivery impossible.Ukraine’s own demand for gas has been reduced, with much of its industry destroyed. The country produces almost enough for its needs. But it imports most of its oil, especially diesel for the generators it uses during blackouts—and for military vehicles. Ukraine buys diesel from various traders, and its origin is often not known. But the Ukrainian energy adviser confirms, half smiling, that a bit of the fuel powering Ukrainian tanks is probably Russian.■This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Vestigial network""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
77,Will Russia’s drone attacks change the war in Ukraine?,,19/10/22,"UKRAINIANS SAY the drones buzz like flying mopeds or chainsaws. In recent days Russia has unleashed a deadly wave of drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, the capital. Most of the drones appear to have been the Iranian-made Shahed-136, a “kamikaze” model that detonates on impact. They have only recently made an appearance in Ukraine but quickly left their mark. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, claims that Russia has ordered 2,400 Iranian drones. What impact might they have on the war?Kamikaze drones, also known as loitering munitions or “suicide” drones, have proliferated in recent years. Their effectiveness varies. Switchblade 300s, a bomb-carrying drone supplied by America to Ukraine, are among the best. A live video stream allows a remote operator to hit moving targets or call off an attack likely to cause collateral damage. The drone and all its gear weighs just 2.5kg, fits in a backpack and takes minutes to launch. Though relatively slow, the Switchblade is quiet, thanks to its electric motor. Its range is roughly 10km and the operator can adjust the attack trajectory to tweak the amount of damage caused on impact.Iran’s drones are a blunter tool—but deliver a bigger blast. The Shahed-136 is equipped to carry around 50kg of explosives for around 2,000 kilometres. That is well beyond the range of the HIMARS rockets America provides to Ukraine, so taking out Shahed launching sites will probably be difficult. But the drone has big weaknesses too. With a top speed of 185kmh, it is faster than the Switchblade but still slow enough to be picked off by rifles or machineguns. And it seems to have been used only against stationary targets. The drone’s engines are sold online and experts reckon its electronics are also civilian-made. This means its satellite guidance system is probably more susceptible to electromagnetic jamming than more high-tech models. Ukraine says most of the incoming Shahed drones have been destroyed. Even so, at around $20,000 a pop, Shahed-136 drones are cheap enough to be used in huge numbers. Hundreds have already been launched. Russia’s decision to target Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has proved effective: Mr Zelensky says a third of power stations have been hit. Another Russian objective might be to deplete Ukraine’s limited supply of pricey air-defence missiles by provoking their use. And by striking cities Russia will hope to demoralise Ukrainians.But this is a dangerous gambit for Russia. The images of civilian casualties being pulled from smashed buildings will stoke anger beyond Ukraine’s borders. On October 18th an Israeli minister called on his own government to start sending Ukraine military gear. Israel has maintained a working relationship with the Kremlin, but on October 19th it offered to help Ukraine develop air-attack warning systems. This shift hints at the degree to which Russia’s brutality could harden attitudes to its war of aggression in thus-far neutral countries. Ukraine’s allies will send even more weapons. America is soon due to deliver Switchblade 600s, which boast warheads powerful enough to destroy tanks. And Ukraine’s resistance so far suggests that Russia’s terror from skies will steel its opponent’s will to fight. ■More from The Economist explains:Who is Sergei Surovikin, Russia’s new commander in Ukraine?Why the exodus of Russians to Central Asia mattersWhat is annexation?This article appeared in the The Economist explains section of the print edition under the headline ""Will Russia’s drone attacks change the war in Ukraine?""The Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
78,Russian hackers are preparing for a new campaign in Ukraine,,29/03/23,"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine warRussia’s cyber-offensive last year was fast, furious—and underwhelming. In it, hackers conducted perhaps the largest ever assault on computer networks. Ukraine, well-prepared and supported by foreign tech companies and allies, parried many of these blows, keeping communications and crucial government services online against all expectations. But the cyberwar, like the physical one, is evolving.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Russian cyber-forces, portrayed as lumbering bumblers, have in fact adapted to circumstances, argues Dan Black, who served in NATO’s cyber-threat analysis branch until December and now works for Mandiant, a cyber-security firm within Google. During its offensive in eastern Ukraine between April and July, Russia expanded its cyber-operations in Poland and eastern Europe to collect intelligence on arms shipments to Ukraine. The GRU, Russia’s military-intelligence agency, began using more malware from criminal markets to augment fancier home-made tools.In a paper for the IISS, a think-tank, Mr Black says Russian forces showed signs of “a more prepared and reinvigorated cyber-programme” from October, during Ukrainian offensives in the south and east. That included heightened cyber-attacks against energy, water and logistics targets in parallel with drone and missile strikes on Ukraine’s power grid. This pointed to a co-ordinated strategy to ratchet up cross-domain pressure, he argues. A report published by Ukraine’s main cyber-security agency on March 8th showed that “critical” and “high-severity” cyber-incidents, the two most serious sorts, leapt in December, reaching the highest level since the first week of the war. That pressure is still building. On March 15th Microsoft Threat Intelligence, which monitors Ukrainian networks, warned that the GRU was “preparing for a renewed destructive campaign”, including reconnaissance against important targets. Its deployment of “wiper” malware, which destroys data, was “reminiscent of the early days of the invasion”. Between January and mid-February hackers working for all three main Russian intelligence services tried to penetrate government and military targets in 17 European countries, paving the way for either espionage or disruption—access to a network allows both. Russian cyber-doctrine also puts a premium on information warfare. In November a website began publishing private messages from two senior officials in Moldova—a classic “hack-and-leak” operation akin to the one the GRU conducted ahead of America’s presidential elections in 2016. On March 10th the White House publicly accused Russia of trying to foment a coup in Moldova. Recent Russian propaganda has also spread false claims that Ukrainian refugees abroad were being extradited and conscripted into Ukraine’s army.Russia’s army is exhausting itself in crude and costly ground assaults across eastern Ukraine. It has little offensive potential left. But it is easier to execute cyber-attacks than raise new battalions.Some sophisticated operations are only just coming to light: Microsoft recently revealed that Russia had been using a “zero-day” vulnerability—one that is previously unknown and thus impossible to patch—for over a year until it was disclosed in mid-March. The vulnerability was used not just against Ukraine, but also government, military, energy and logistics sectors in Poland, Romania and Turkey. “European energy security and logistics are in the cross-hairs,” warns Mr Black, “and these priorities aren’t fading away.”Ukraine needs continuous cyber-aid as much as a steady supply of shells. On February 22nd Dutch spy agencies warned that Ukraine’s staunch defence could “probably only be sustained as long as Western support remains as intensive and adaptive as the cyber-operations of the Russian intelligence services.” Mr Black agrees. “The reality is that the war is not over,” he writes. “Interactions between offence and defence could still change as Russia continues to learn from its early shortcomings.” ■Curious about the world?

79,What Russia is up to in Ukraine,,11/02/15,"By E.L.MANY Westerners find Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine mystifying. It has brought Russia economic woe (sanctions and a shattered credit rating) and international isolation. Why fight so hard for a slice of another country’s rust-belt? Is it part of a sinister strategy to divide and weaken the West, an irrational outbreak of paranoia about an imagined outside threat to Russia, or a desperate attempt to distract domestic opinion from the regime’s political and economic failure?The Kremlin has annexed the Crimean peninsula (the site of an important Russian naval base) and stoked a separatist rebellion in two of Ukraine’s easternmost provinces, Lugansk and Donetsk. The rebels, with strong Russian military and intelligence backing, have proclaimed “people’s republics” there and have continued to advance into the rest of Ukraine, in defiance of a ceasefire agreed in Minsk in September. Ukraine is losing the war and is desperate for financial and military help from the West. America is mulling arms deliveries, but holding back to see if a last-ditch Franco-German diplomatic deal can bring a truce. Few outside Russia believe the Kremlin’s justification for the war. Russians in Ukraine were not being persecuted. The government in Kiev is not “fascist” (extreme-right parties fare worse in Ukraine than they do in Western Europe). Far from menacing Russia, NATO countries have slashed defence spending, just as Russia is rearming. The three main theories about Vladimir Putin’s motivations could be summed up as “bad”, “mad” or “sad”.Advocates of the “bad” theory think that Russia is exploiting, and accentuating, Western weakness and over-stretch. Europe is divided, America distracted. This is a good time to re-establish a soft hegemony, based on energy, bribery, propaganda and subversion, over a large chunk of the former Soviet empire. The supporters of the “mad” theory think this is too complacent. Mr Putin, like many autocrats before him, has concocted a toxic ideological cocktail of ethno-nationalism, Soviet nostalgia and Russian imperialism, and drunk it. He is countering an invented Western threat with increasing recklessness. The “sad” camp thinks that the fundamental point about Russia is its weakness. A stagnant economy, endemic corruption, crumbling infrastructure and disillusion from the elite to the grassroots are insoluble problems for the Russian leader. He came to power on a surge of oil and gas revenues but as that tide runs out, he is stranded. Propaganda and sabre-rattling are no substitute for what matters: economic strength. The West needs to be firm and patient, but not to exaggerate the threat from Russia.These approaches are not mutually exclusive: all three have elements of truth. They have one big thing in common. They offer little hope to Ukraine. Whether Mr Putin is cynically destabilising the country to humiliate the West, or because he truly fears that it might one day be a European-style success story, or simply to feed the mob at home, does not greatly matter for the families of the thousands of dead, or for the millions who are now facing poverty and misery.Dig deeper:The sad reality is Putin is winning (September 2014) Putin's popularity at home might be about to change  (December 2014)How the Russians got what they wanted (September 2014)The Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
80,How to win Ukraine’s long war,,30/06/22,"Ukraine won the short war. Mobile and resourceful, its troops inflicted terrible losses and confounded Russian plans to take Kyiv. Now comes the long war. It will drain weapons, lives and money until one side loses the will to fight on. So far, this is a war that Russia is winning. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.In recent days its forces have taken the eastern city of Severodonetsk. They are advancing on Lysychansk and may soon control all of Luhansk province. They also threaten Slovyansk, in the north of next-door Donetsk. Ukrainian leaders say they are outgunned and lack ammunition. Their government reckons as many as 200 of its troops are dying each day.Fortunately for Ukraine, that is not the end. The Russian advance is slow and costly. With nato-calibre weapons, fresh tactics and enough financial aid, Ukraine has every chance of forcing back Russia’s armies. Even if lost territory will be hard to retake, Ukraine can demonstrate the futility of Vladimir Putin’s campaign and emerge as a democratic, Westward-looking state. But to do so it needs enduring support. And that is still in doubt.On the face of it, a long war suits Russia. Both sides are using huge amounts of ammunition, but Russia has vastly more. The Russian economy is much larger than Ukraine’s and in far better shape. In pursuit of victory, Russia is willing to terrorise and demoralise the Ukrainians by committing war crimes, as it did by striking a shopping mall in Kremenchuk this week. If needs be, Mr Putin will impose grievous suffering on his own people. However, the long war does not have to be fought on Mr Putin’s terms. Potentially, Ukraine has vast numbers of motivated fighters. It can be supplied by the West’s defence industry. In 2020, before sanctions, the economies of nato were more than ten times bigger than Russia’s. Ukraine’s turnaround begins on the battlefield, by stopping and reversing the Russian advance. Mr Putin’s generals will continue to have more weapons, but the sophisticated nato systems now arriving have longer range and greater accuracy. By adopting tactics devised in the cold war, when nato too was outnumbered by the Red Army, Ukraine should be able to destroy Russian command posts and supply depots. Ukraine scored a success on June 30th, when it used nato weapons to drive Russian forces off Snake Island, a strategic prize in the Black Sea. It should aim to impose a “hurting stalemate”, in which it takes back similarly symbolically important territory, such as the city of Kherson, imposing a heavy price on Russia.If Russia starts to lose ground on the battlefield, dissent and infighting may spread in the Kremlin. Western intelligence services believe that Mr Putin is being kept in the dark by his subordinates. He has a habit of replacing his commanders—reportedly including General Alexander Dvornikov, brought in after the invasion’s first chaotic weeks. The West can raise the cost to Russia of a long war by continuing to press sanctions, which threaten lasting harm to Russia’s economy. It can split Russia’s elites from Mr Putin by welcoming dissenters from business and politics, and encouraging them to see that their country should not throw away its future on a pointless and costly campaign.Will the West stay the course? At a summit on June 23rd, the European Union awarded Ukraine candidate status, promising a deep level of engagement over the next decade. At another summit in Germany this week, the g7 affirmed and strengthened sanctions against Russia. And at a third in Madrid, nato acknowledged the Russian threat by substantially increasing its presence on the alliance’s eastern front. Yet Ukraine is a heavy burden. Western defence industries are formidable, but struggle to produce large volumes, especially of ammunition. Ukraine’s government has a monthly deficit of $5bn and the country will need rebuilding after the war. Public support for Ukraine in the West will be buffeted by a host of pressures, from inflation to elections—including, as soon as 2023, campaigning in America that may involve a presidential bid by that Ukrainophobic Putin admirer, Donald Trump. And the global costs of a long war will grow. Mr Putin has been blockading exports of grains and sunflower oil from Ukraine’s ports, which will cause unrest and starvation in poorer importing countries. He seems to be trying to create gas shortages in the eu this winter by preventing members from building stocks over the summer. If unity falls apart over energy, as eu states hoard gas, it will disintegrate over Ukraine, too. To complicate matters further, nato members worry that if Ukraine gains the upper hand, Mr Putin will escalate. That could draw them into a catastrophic war with Russia. You can see where Mr Putin is heading. He will take as much of Ukraine as he can, declare victory and then call on Western nations to impose his terms on Ukraine. In exchange, he will spare the rest of the world from ruin, hunger, cold and the threat of nuclear Armageddon. To accept that deal would be a grave miscalculation. Ukraine would face permanent Russian aggression. The more Mr Putin believes he has succeeded in Ukraine, the more belligerent he will become. He set out his ambitions in a speech this month, smirking as he talked about how Peter the Great seized parts of Sweden. He will fight tomorrow with whatever weapons work for him today. That means resorting to war crimes and nuclear threats, starving the world and freezing Europe.The best way to prevent the next war is to defeat him in this one. Leaders need to explain to their people that they are not only defending an abstract principle in Ukraine, but also their most fundamental interest: their own security. The eu needs to shore up its energy markets so that they do not fracture next winter. Ukraine must have more weapons. The risk of escalation today is real, but if a bad peace is forced on Ukraine Mr Putin’s nuclear threats will not stop. They will only become more dangerous, especially if Russia’s conventional forces are at a disadvantage. In the long war ordinary Russians will suffer and Ukrainians endure unspeakable pain for Mr Putin’s vanity. To prevail means marshalling resources and shoring up Ukraine as a viable, sovereign, Western-leaning country—an outcome that its defiant people crave. Ukraine and its backers have the men, money and materiel to overcome Mr Putin. Do they all have the will? ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.

81,Could the war in Ukraine go nuclear?,,29/09/22,"Sixty years ago the world was staring at a nuclear cataclysm. The Cuban missile crisis began in October 1962 when America detected Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. It blockaded the island, and debated invading it. The Soviets yielded, removing their nukes; America secretly removed nuclear-tipped missiles of its own from Turkey. Annihilation was averted. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Memories of those terrifying times are being revived by the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has repeatedly warned that he could resort to nuclear weapons. On September 21st he said he would use “all weapons systems available” to defend the “territorial integrity” of Russia—by implication including all the Ukrainian land he is annexing through sham referendums. ”It’s not a bluff,” said Mr Putin. In response Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, sternly warned Russia of “catastrophic consequences” if it used nuclear weapons. The world thus faces what may be the worst period of nuclear peril since Cuba, says Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association, an American lobby group. Russian commentators have drawn explicit parallels between the crises. Both were caused by insecurity provoked by a rival’s expansion “right to the doorstep of one’s own country: Cuba then, Ukraine now”, writes Dmitri Trenin, a Russian analyst, on the state-owned rt website. This time, though, things are different in several important ways. The Cuban crisis lasted 13 days. The war in Ukraine is more than 200 days old, and could last for hundreds more. In Cuba the nukes themselves were the crux of the matter. In Ukraine they are a shield to protect a Russian land-grab. And the nature of the threat has changed with Russia’s fortunes on the battlefield. At first, Western officials worried about nuclear escalation resulting from Russian success. If it took Ukraine, might it push further into the Baltic states, or strike at nato depots that were supplying weapons to Ukrainian forces? That could have led to a conventional war, which might have escalated into a nuclear one.Now the worry is about Russian failures. Ukrainian troops have retaken thousands of square miles of territory; a mobilisation at home has pushed hundreds of thousands of Russians to protest or flee. In the 1960s neither John F. Kennedy nor Nikita Khrushchev, the American and Soviet leaders, wanted a nuclear war. Now, some worry that a flailing Mr Putin might be tempted to gamble that nuclear weapons could help reverse his misfortune. The Cuban missile crisis was largely about “strategic” nuclear weapons—the biggest sort, designed to wipe out enemy cities far from the battlefield. The question in Ukraine revolves mainly around the non-strategic, or “tactical” kind. These are of shorter range and lower explosive power. (Many are nevertheless more powerful than the atomic bombs used against Japan in the second world war). America and the Soviet Union once maintained huge arsenals of tactical warheads for use against each others’ armies on the plains of Europe. In the decades after the cold war, nato gave up all but around 200 of its stockpile, concluding that precision-guided conventional weapons could do the job more cheaply and with fewer complications. Russia’s armed forces held on to 2,000 or so. Nuclear weapons can make up for weaker conventional forces. “The power balance matters less than the willingness to use nukes,” says Francis Gavin, a historian at Johns Hopkins University. “That creates an incentive to be irresponsible.”Experts see three main ways in which Russia might use a nuclear weapon: a “demonstration shot” that does not kill anyone; a strike on Ukraine; and an attack on nato. Russia might start on the “escalation ladder” by conducting nuclear tests, either underground or, more dramatically, in the atmosphere. This could be over the Black Sea or high above Ukraine itself, avoiding deaths but causing an electromagnetic pulse that would fry electrical equipment. But if Ukraine kept on fighting despite the demonstration, Russia would incur global opprobrium for no military gain.Russian generals might prefer to nuke military objectives directly, not least because the Russian army is short of manpower and materiel. Targets could include Ukrainian airfields, logistics hubs and concentrations of artillery, says Ben Barry of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. Yet Ukraine’s forces are mostly dispersed, and armies can be surprisingly resilient. One study examining a hypothetical war between India and Pakistan estimated that a five-kiloton bomb (about a third the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima) would knock out just 13 tanks if they were widely spread. Mr Barry reckons four tactical weapons would be needed to neutralise a Ukrainian brigade (roughly 3,000-5,000 soldiers) even if it was concentrated for an offensive. More destructively still, Russia might choose to attack a Ukrainian city to force a surrender. But this raises the possibility of a direct nato intervention and the destruction of Russia’s armies. A nuclear attack on nato would be a potentially suicidal proposition, given that three of its members—America, Britain and France—have nuclear weapons of their own. Every option, in other words, comes with big downsides. “It is very hard to make nuclear threats work,” notes Eric Edelman, a former under-secretary for policy at the Pentagon. At times during the cold war—in the Korean war, for instance—America toyed with using nuclear weapons but decided against it as morally repugnant, militarily useless or dangerous. But responding to nuclear threats is hard, too. Deterrence rests on a great deal of ambiguity. American officials will not say publicly what they mean by “catastrophic consequences”, though it hints at the risk of a direct clash between Russia and America. But they claim to have been explicit in private warnings to the Kremlin, and have told journalists that the response is likely to be conventional, not nuclear. In doing so, complains Mr Edelman, “they are undermining the deterrent threat.”America’s warnings are aimed at Russia, America’s allies and the American public. It must be seen to take the threat seriously but not be intimidated; it must respond in a way that is vague yet credible. Whatever happens with Russia will affect its contest with China, not least over Taiwan. Thus far, President Joe Biden has tried to balance two principles: help Ukraine defend itself, but avoid a third world war. If the Russians detonate nuclear weapons, he has said that the response will depend “on the extent of what they do”. One option would be to pile more economic pressure on Russia, perhaps through secondary sanctions on those buying its oil and gas, with the hope of turning Mr Putin into even more of an international pariah. America could push India and China to isolate Russia. Both have obliquely signalled disapproval of its conduct in the war. But India relies on Russia for weapons, and China sees it as a useful counter-balance to America.Another option would be for the West to help Ukraine fight in a nuclear battlefield, by providing advice, protective gear and decontamination equipment. It could also supply more advanced arms—such as Western-made tanks, fighter jets and longer-ranged missiles—that have thus far been deemed too escalatory. At the other end of the scale, America, Britain or France could respond with a limited nuclear strike of their own. But that risks a wider nuclear war—and Russia has more tactical nukes than its Western rivals. The middle way—a conventional military response—is the likeliest. This might include deploying nato troops to Ukraine, or carrying out direct strikes on Russian targets. America could, for instance, destroy the ports, air bases, or mobile missile launchers used in any Russian nuclear attack. Ben Hodges, a retired general who once commanded American ground forces in Europe, suggests sinking Russia’s Black Sea fleet, or destroying its bases in Crimea. Mr Putin, though, could raise the ante. He might launch a counter-strike against comparable targets—American warships in the Mediterranean, say, or military facilities on nato soil. In other words, even a conventional response could easily bring about a direct nato-Russia conflict, with its attendant risk of nuclear war. All of which raises the question: would America really run such risks for the sake of Ukraine, which is not a formal military ally? Barack Obama, who as president refused to arm Ukraine, argued that Russia, in the end, cared more about Ukraine than America did, saying “we have to be very clear about what our core interests are and what we are willing to go to war for.”Those who favour standing by Ukraine offer two responses. The first is that the risks are less acute than they seem. Russia is in no position to fight a conventional war against America and its 29 nato allies; a nuclear war would risk the total destruction of both sides. The second riposte is that the risks are worth it. Allowing Russia to use nuclear blackmail to seize territory would encourage autocrats everywhere to do the same. “That would be a terrible world to live in. The cost of stopping it later is higher than stopping it at the outset,” argues Mr Edelman.For now, to everyone’s great relief, deterrence is holding. Mr Putin has not used nuclear weapons, nor is nato fighting in Ukraine. America says it has seen no evidence of Russia readying its nuclear armaments for use. America and Russia are continuing to exchange information about their respective strategic arsenals.For Max Hastings, author of “Abyss”, a new history of the Cuban crisis, the main lesson of 1962 also applies to 2022: “Be afraid.” What averted a cataclysm was Kennedy’s and Khruschev’s fear of nuclear war. America’s success was the product of Kennedy’s sober mixture of resolve and a willingness to compromise in private. That suggests the West should continue to help Ukraine defend itself while “recognising that somewhere along the line it will probably end up with a dirty deal” to end the war, argues Mr Hastings.The trouble is that, at the moment, Mr Putin is raising the stakes, not seeking a deal. His annexation of Ukrainian territory and mobilisation of extra troops risks elevating a “special military operation”, which can be ended whenever he chooses, into a war for Russian soil, which he must win or lose. Unlike the collective Soviet leadership of 1962, which imposed some moderation, Mr Putin’s underlings seem powerless to restrain him. He has long equated his own rule with Russia’s existence. In 2018, he spoke in near-mystical terms about using nuclear weapons to defend Russia: “We, the victims of aggression, as martyrs, will go to heaven, while they will just die, because they will not even have time to repent.” Thus the world watches another nuclear crisis unfold: will Mr Putin cut his losses, fight on, or take the biggest risk of all? ■This article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline ""Climbing the ladder""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents It has transformed crime not only in Russia and Ukraine, but around the worldSudan is not a one-off.

82,"The war has devastated Ukraine’s environment, too",,12/01/23,"Before the Russian invasion, people from nearby villages used to flock to the banks of the Oskil reservoir, which stretches for about a hundred kilometres south of Kupyansk, in eastern Ukraine, to swim, listen to birdsong and catch fish. Today, much of the area is changed beyond all recognition. Destroyed villages, recaptured by the Ukrainians during a counter-offensive four months ago, charred trees and the husks of Russian tanks line the reservoir’s eastern banks. Last spring, to prevent Russian troops from crossing the Donets River, downstream from the Oskil, Ukrainian forces blew up the reservoir’s floodgates. The move helped slow the Russian advance. But it also spelled doom for the Oskil. Over 350m cubic metres of water gushed out of the reservoir. The water level plunged, exposing great swathes of the reservoir’s bed. Birds that once nested in the area disappeared. Some 2m fish are thought to have died. Local wells have dried up. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Forests ravaged by fires caused by relentless shelling, or cut down to build trenches; groundwater and soil contaminated by heavy metals and toxic chemicals from detonated munitions; and wild animals killed or driven from their habitat: these are some of the less talked-about victims of the war in Ukraine. Because about 18% of the country remains occupied by Russian forces, measuring the impact of the invasion may be impossible as long as the fighting rages. But even the fragmented data available reveal a picture of environmental catastrophe. Since the start of the war, Ukraine’s environment ministry has recorded almost 2,300 instances of environmental damage caused by the fighting. About 2.9m hectares of the country’s protected areas, home to thousands of species of plants and animals, are at risk of destruction, the ministry estimates. Another 3m hectares of forests, about a third of the total, have been affected by the fighting already. Of these, at least 23,300 hectares have completely burned down. Illegal logging has been documented at many of the 18 national parks and nature reserves that have been illegally occupied by the Russians. The war, say Ukrainian officials and scientists, is also to blame for the deaths of thousands of dolphins in the Black Sea, killed by mines and sonar from Russian submarines. (On the other hand, air quality in parts of Ukraine has improved because of lower traffic.) Other dangers, notably the risk of damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by the Russians since early March, lurk ahead. So far, the combined damage already amounts to more than $46bn, which Ukraine will in time demand as war reparations from Russia, according to Ruslan Strilets, the Ukrainian environment minister. Air pollution, at $27bn, accounts for the bulk of the sum. In only ten months, over 42m tonnes of carbon dioxide, roughly the same as the annual emissions of Bulgaria, have been released into the atmosphere as a result of the war, the ministry says. Forest fires caused by shelling, as well as Russian attacks on Ukrainian depots, which have caused 680,000 tons of oil and fuel to go up in flames, are mostly to blame for the emissions. The war has poisoned large areas of Ukrainian farmland. Dangerous chemicals and fuels, released from exploded rockets and the tens of thousands of artillery shells that are being fired by both sides every day, have leaked into the ground along the length of the front line. Such contamination can harm local ecosystems and crops decades after the guns have gone quiet, says Olexiy Angurets, the author of an upcoming report on the war’s impact on the environment. Damage to farmland has already cost Ukraine $18bn, says the environment ministry. Ukraine’s environmental record was hardly stellar before Russia invaded. The country ranked 52nd (out of 180) in last year’s Environmental Performance Index, a measure compiled by experts at Yale and Columbia universities. Post-war reconstruction may offer a unique chance for improvement. “What we’re afraid of is that recovery will be just a few green projects here and there,” says Tetiana Riabokin of the World Wide Fund for Nature Ukraine. The country needs to place the transition to a low-carbon economy at the heart of its recovery plan, she says. This would also make the programme more palatable to foreign donors and taxpayers, and improve Ukraine’s prospects for EU membership.For the most part, repairing the harm done to the environment will have to wait until the end of the war. But some projects are already going ahead. Over the past year, Ukraine’s forest agency has planted over 180m new trees as part of a reforestation programme. In late September its foresters opened a tree nursery a few kilometres from the border with Belarus, from where one wave of the Russian assault came in February 2022. “We showed them we’re not scared,” says Mr Strilets, “and that victory will come.” ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.

83,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes the West to re-arm,,28/03/22,"BY INVADING UKRAINE, Vladimir Putin has revitalised the world’s democracies and strengthened NATO’s resolve, President Joe Biden told an audience in Warsaw on March 26th. Two days later he submitted a budget to Congress that included $813bn in defence spending. He called it “one of the largest investments in our national security in history”. Among other things, Mr Biden said, it was intended “to forcefully respond to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine”. In Europe, meanwhile, many NATO allies are beefing up their forces even faster. But will the extra money for weapons be spent effectively? Begin with America’s gargantuan defence budget, the largest in the world, accounting for about 40% of global military expenditures. The Biden administration’s numbers may not quite match its rhetoric. The additional $17bn above the $796bn expected spending this year represents a 2% increase. That is lower than the budget’s projected rate of inflation of 2.5%, which some economists think is anyhow optimistic given the pace of price rises so far this year. The administration prefers to highlight the 4% increase in the base budget for the Department of Defence, which excludes such things as spending on nuclear warheads by the Department of Energy, and supplemental budgets, eg, to help Ukraine and resettle Afghans who worked with America.“This is going to be a real-terms cut in defence spending,” says Todd Harrison of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington. “Congress is not likely to be happy.” Mr Harrison predicts that Congress, which can modify the president’s request, will add a hefty slice of extra spending—perhaps another $30bn—just as it did with the defence budget in the current year. “The politics on the defence budget have really changed substantially in the past two months. A year ago, we were hearing progressives in the Democratic Party talk about trying to cut the defence budget by 10%. Those calls have gone silent.”As a share of American GDP, defence spending has in fact fallen over the years, from 4.7% in 2010 to an estimated 3.3% this year. Leading Republicans have called for a budget that adds 5% above inflation. If they take control of one or both houses of Congress in this year’s mid-term elections, they will have the clout to push for bigger increases. Robert Gates, a Republican who served as defence secretary under Barack Obama, wrote in the Washington Post: “We need a larger, more advanced military in every branch.” But he also bemoaned “the wasteful, painfully slow defence bureaucracy”. And he chastised the “parochial” ways of Congress, which often refuses to allow the rationalisation of military bases or the scrapping of older weapons to save money for new ones. The president’s request is something of a muddle. Although issued late, it does not take account of money that Congress recently agreed to spend, not least on Ukraine. Officials acknowledge that it may have to be reviewed later in the year. What is more, the request was not preceded, as is customary, by the publication of a national security strategy. A long-awaited review of nuclear policy is yet to be released. Officials insist that the war in Ukraine has not changed their underlying analysis: Russia presents an acute menace and China is the longer-term “pacing challenge”. Over the years the breakdown of spending has shifted from the army to the navy and especially the air force—a trend that continues in the president’s request—to strengthen the latter two in Asia in particular. And a growing share, an extra 9.5%, has gone to “research, development, test, and evaluation”, not least in artificial intelligence. This helps to maintain America’s military edge in the long term, but generates little new military capability in the meantime. That suggests the administration does not think it will be at war with China soon, despite the warnings of some commanders that China could try to invade Taiwan before the end of the decade.For America’s European allies, though, it is Russia that poses not just the most immediate threat, but also the biggest. That explains why they have been announcing crash programmes to boost their armed forces and meet NATO’s target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Poland has announced plans to increase spending from 2% of GDP to 3%; Romania and Lithuania are aiming for more than 2.5%. The biggest wodge of new money will come from Germany, which seems to have shed its sheepishness about arming itself in a turnaround being referred to as a Zeitenwende (“turning-point”). Last month it announced plans to raise defence spending from 1.5% of GDP to 2%, creating a €100bn ($110bn) fund to jump-start military procurement. If the target is met this year, it would release an extra €18bn—a larger sum than the entire defence budget of any European ally apart from Britain, France and Italy.But in the scramble for more weapons, attempts to avoid fragmentation and duplication, which plague European defence, may again be sacrificed. “There was little co-ordination when European countries started to cut defence spending after the financial crisis,” says Claudia Major of SWP, a think-tank in Berlin. “Will Europeans do better when budgets are increasing? I am not very optimistic.”On the face of it, European allies should have little trouble dealing with Russia. Collectively their armed forces are roughly the size of Russia’s, their population is about three times larger, their defence spending is about five times larger, and their economic output is about ten times larger. But defence spending in Europe is inefficient. It is parcelled up among more than two dozen armies, navies, air forces and ministries of defence. In 2017 the European Commission noted that its members (21 of whose 27 members are in NATO) fielded 178 major weapons systems, compared with America’s 30. There were 17 main models of battle tank versus one; 29 types of destroyers and frigates against four; and 20 fighter jets instead of six.Successive German parliamentary reports suggest Germany’s forces are in poor shape: many units are unfit for combat; formations are often cannibalised to provide equipment to those on deployment or required for NATO tasks, leaving little for exercises. On the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the head of Germany’s land forces, Lieutenant-General Alfons Mais, vented his frustration: “You wake up in the morning and you realise: there is war in Europe [...],” he wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “The army I am allowed to lead is more or less bare. The options we can offer the politicians to support the alliance are extremely limited.”Countries are rushing to add military capacity. To do so, argues Ben Barry of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London, start by “filling the potholes”, ie, restocking arsenals with munitions and improving training. Second, try to speed up delivery of weapons already in the pipeline. Third, buy equipment that exists or is close to delivery, rather than trying to develop whole new systems from scratch. Germany’s first big decision, for instance, has been to buy 35 stealthy American F-35 jets to replace ageing Tornados, to fulfill Germany’s role in delivering NATO’s nuclear bombs. Germany has also decided to buy Eurofighter Typhoons (which it makes with Britain, Italy and Spain) adapted for electronic warfare. All this will discomfit France, which fears that Germany will be less committed to the Future Combat Air System, a Franco-German-Spanish project linking manned and unmanned aircraft, to enter into service in 2040.An underlying malaise preventing co-operation is what some call “strategic cacophony”, or European countries’ inability to agree on which threats are the most pressing. The war in Ukraine may bring more harmony. And the EU’s new “strategic compass” seeks to set out joint priorities. Yet the problem of “bonsai armies” remains. The long-recognised answer is greater pooling and sharing of military assets among allies. There are a few examples, such as the air-policing mission that NATO conducts on behalf of the three small Baltic states, or joint naval procurement by Belgium and the Netherlands. But Nick Witney of the European Council on Foreign Relations argues, “There has been a profound lack of seriousness about the fundamental need for greater integration.” A recent report by the European Defence Agency, set up to promote cross-border defence co-operation, notes that EU countries have fallen far short of targets for collaboration. Just 11% of European procurement and 6% of research and technology were done collaboratively in 2020, instead of the intended 35% and 20% respectively.“Defence is the last bastion of national sovereignty in Europe,” says Ms Major, “But what kind of sovereignty do European countries really have when they cannot defend themselves?” Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThe Florida governor hoped to showcase his conservative credentials.

84,What would push the West and Russia to nuclear war?,,02/08/22,"“The word ‘impossible’,” quipped Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, “means ‘possible in the future’.” Javelin anti-tank missiles, forbidden by America when Vladimir Putin took the first chunks of Ukraine in 2014, came in a trickle from 2017 and then a flood when he invaded again in February. Stinger anti-aircraft weapons, similarly refused, arrived in March. And the long-awaitedhimars rocket launchers have been taking out command posts and weapons dumps far behind Russia’s front lines since June. F-16 fighter jets may come one day.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.America and Europe hail Ukraine’s fighting spirit, which raises a nagging question: why are they not sending more weapons, more quickly? The latest $1bn American military package for Ukraine includes munitions for himars but no more launchers beyond the current 16, which many experts think insufficient. Officials’ answers vary: the West is giving priority to weapons that are most urgently needed; it has to train Ukrainians to use and maintain their new kit; and they have to show they can use it effectively in battle. The strongest reason for America’s caution, though, is fear of escalation—that Russia might lash out militarily at nato (“horizontal escalation”, in the jargon) or use chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine (“vertical escalation”). Either version would almost certainly draw nato into direct conflict with Russia, and President Joe Biden has vowed to avoid “World War III”. Ukraine’s looming effort to reconquer Kherson is a test. If successful, hawks will see it as proof that Ukraine, given the right help, can win. Doves fret that it could provoke Mr Putin to greater villainy. On the day he invaded Ukraine Mr Putin threatened outsiders thinking of intervening with consequences “such as you have never seen in your entire history”. State media in Russia fantasise about nuclear strikes on the West. For now, though, America says there is no sign that Russia has put its nuclear forces on higher alert. America and Russia still swap information about their long-range nukes. Mr Biden has called on Russia to resume arms-control talks. Russia said sanctions prevent the resumption of on-site inspections. Over five months of fighting, the threshold for a direct clash has repeatedly shifted, without dire consequences for the West. “nato has been brilliant at salami-slicing its assistance,” says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank. “It has given the Ukrainians a fair amount of support, but at no time did it present Russia with a point at which they could say, ‘No further’.”Not all agree. “Every salami-slice means that more innocent Ukrainians are killed,” retorts Ben Hodges, a former head of the American army in Europe. He says the Biden administration “has overstated the risk of escalation”. Russia does not want to take on nato, he says, and a nuclear response is highly unlikely.Others caution that Mr Putin may escalate rather than accept defeat. Samuel Charap of the rand Corporation, a think-tank close to the Pentagon, says Russia has unused military capacity. The air force could also be committed more fully. The more the West helps Ukraine, the more Russia will raise the stakes. “There is no stable equilibrium,” argues Mr Charap. “We are in a slow-moving, incremental escalation.”History suggests that countries can go a long way in waging proxy wars against nuclear powers without atomic retribution (albeit with scares). Think of Russia and China supporting North Vietnam against America in the 1970s; or America arming the Afghan mujahideen to bleed the Soviet Union in the 1980s.Russia’s published doctrine envisages four scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons: detection of a ballistic-missile attack against Russia or its allies; an attack on them with nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction; actions that threaten its nuclear command-and-control systems; and “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy”.The West’s arming of Ukraine falls well short of those red lines. Yet the concept of an existential threat is elastic, notes Bruno Tertrais of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think-tank in France. Mr Putin has called Ukraine “a matter of life and death”. He has also suggested that a major attack on Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, would be similarly grave (explosions rocked an airbase in Crimea on August 9th; see picture here). Others ask, what if Mr Putin regards himself as the state, so that any danger to his regime is deemed an existential threat to Russia? A recent rand paper by Mr Charap and others sets out four scenarios of horizontal escalation. The first is labelled “Pathway 0” because the escalation spiral may already be under way: Russia is bound to respond to military and economic losses inflicted on it, if not now then “in due course”. Next is a pre-emptive attack by Russia if it thinks nato is about to intervene, after it deploys missile systems near the Russian border, say. Third is hitting Western military supply lines that support Ukraine. Last is “a dramatic increase in domestic, economic, and political instability in Russia”. In most cases Russia’s retribution would probably begin covertly—through cyberattacks, sabotage, assassination and more. The pre-emption scenario is most likely to provoke a military attack, perhaps even a nuclear strike. The scenarios may overlap and “all are more dangerous if Russia is losing,” adds Mr Charap.In truth, nobody knows where Mr Putin’s red lines lie. Perhaps not even he does. America has stopped talking of helping Ukraine “win” and of weakening Russia. Instead it speaks of ensuring Ukraine does not lose. In the New York Times in May Mr Biden listed many things America would not do. It would not seek to unseat Mr Putin, nor send troops to Ukraine, nor fight against Russia, nor help Ukraine strike at Russia. It would not “prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia”. Mr Biden warned Russia that using nuclear weapons “would entail severe consequences”. A response would depend on the circumstances, but officials whisper it may involve conventional rather than nuclear strikes. Plainly, Mr Biden does not want to get to that point.While steering around these self-imposed limits, Mr Biden has left his destination unclear. Sources say officials are conducting war games to decide their ultimate objective. For now the administration speaks in bromides, saying it wants “a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine”. It does not adopt Ukraine’s demand for the return of all lost territories, including land Russia took in 2014. Intentionally or not, Mr Biden’s policy is likely to generate a long war or a grinding stalemate. This risks the unity and staying power of Western countries if voters revolt against stagflation, energy scarcity and the bill for supporting Ukraine. That may be Mr Putin’s plan.Yet frustration and uncertainty are in the nature of nuclear dissuasion: America is deterred from intervening directly; Russia from striking at nato. The late Tom Schelling, an economist and nuclear strategist, argued that the brink of war can be unknowable. It is not “the sharp edge of a cliff where one can stand firmly, look down, and decide whether or not to plunge”; instead it is a slippery curved slope where “neither the person standing there nor the onlookers can be quite sure quite how great the risk is.” When the peril is a catastrophic nuclear exchange, who can blame leaders for treading carefully? ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""The rungs of escalation""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
85,Russians in every major city and region call for #nowar,,28/02/22,"Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is not going as planned on the ground. And even back home, the Russian autocrat is facing mounting resistance. On the first day of the invasion more than 1,300 people were arrested in anti-war protests in 51 Russian cities, according to OVD-info, a human-rights group. That number has now swollen to 5,959. Even more are taking their protests online. The hashtag “#нетвойне”, Russian for “no war”, started trending soon after Russian troops rolled into Ukraine. These protest-posts already number in the hundreds of thousands. On Instagram, some 50,000 pictures with the anti-war hashtag were posted between February 26th and 27th alone and now total over 330,000—already 10% of the total number reached by #MeToo posts, which first went viral in 2017. (Twitter does not provide comparable statistics.) To assess the geographical extent of this opposition, The Economist constructed a dataset of 51,773 unique posts from Twitter and Instagram that used the hashtag. Of these we were able to identify the geographic location of 7,120, of which 3,495 were marked as posted from within Russia. We found anti-war posts coming from Russia’s 50 largest cities, across all 11 time zones and in 83 out of 85 federal subjects (ie, regions, such as oblasts and republics). Abroad, the Russian-language hashtag was found in 91 other countries, including Ukraine, Belarus, America and China.Those joining the movement have ranged from the country’s leading chess and tennis players to the daughter of Mr Putin’s own spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Ivan Urgant, the host of a popular talk-show on Channel One, Russia’s main broadcaster, saw his programme taken off the air after he used the hashtag on Instagram (the channel claims this was because of a scheduling problem). The Russian authorities have responded by tightening their grip on the internet. Access to Meta’s platforms have been restricted after Facebook refused to stop the independent fact-checking of Russian state-owned news content. Netblocks, an internet-monitoring group, also found that access to Twitter had been restricted in Russia by the morning of February 26th.Even on these platforms, and others, such as Telegram and TikTok, fear of reprisals probably leads to a degree of self-censorship. The regime has been known to use facial-recognition software to identify and harass protesters. Some victims of this have said the authorities found their pictures on social media. The true force of opposition to Mr Putin’s war is unknown. ■For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter.

86,Russia says Western sanctions and arms shipments to Ukraine are acts of war,,22/03/22,"THE BIPARTISAN ceasefire in America over foreign policy is eroding and Republicans are chiding Joe Biden for being weak in dealing with Russia. “We’re not doing nearly enough, quickly enough to help the Ukrainians,” said Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, on March 16th. After a video address to the joint houses of Congress by Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the Ukrainian president asked for a no-fly zone over his country, Republican demands for that have grown clamorous.For their part, the Democrats accuse Republicans of recklessness. Chris Coons, who has Mr Biden’s old Senate seat from Delaware, complained that those who “run to the cameras with forceful proposals…are the last to come to classified briefings”. The administration seems to be trying to steer a course between helping Ukraine fight its battles while avoiding being sucked into a war with its old nuclear-armed adversary. It reportedly conducted a legal review of what weapons and intelligence it can send (in part because of restrictions in domestic legislation). So is it possible to say where the middle course lies? Are there any rules or guidelines about what countries that are not directly participating in the fighting can do in wartime?The simple answer is, not formally. Countries tend to do what they think they can get away with. America armed the mujahideen fighters resisting the Soviet conquest of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union sent tanks, helicopters and other military assistance to help the North battle American forces during the Vietnam war. But there is a careful calibration to be made. Tacitly, writes Steven Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, in a recent essay, a set of rules seems to be developing to reduce the chances of a direct conflict between Russia and NATO. These disallow a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but seem to permit the West to share intelligence and at least some arms with Ukraine, and to impose economic sanctions on Russia without provoking a military response.There used to be a body of international treaties and precedents, referred to as “the law of neutrality”, which set out the conduct expected of neutral countries in times of conflict. They were supposed to treat the warring parties equally; there were arcane rules about what that entailed in practice. But this system was predicated on the idea that war was a normal part of international relations, and that belligerent states should be left to get on with it. That view fell out of favour after the first world war, however, and was completely discarded after the second, when a new set of rules was enshrined in the charter of the United Nations. The UN charter states: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” But if one country ignores this prohibition and invades another, there is no implication that third parties are obliged to remain neutral or treat the belligerents equally. Instead, the UN charter talks about “the inherent right of...collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs”. In other words, it is perfectly legitimate for other countries to come to the aid of one that has been attacked.Marko Milanovic of the University of Nottingham argues that collective self-defence would even allow NATO countries to attack Russia itself, subject only to another UN rule that such actions must be “proportionate and necessary”. Collective self-defence, he suggests, does not require outsiders to distinguish between passive support (supplying weapons, imposing sanctions) and active fighting. Both happened after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990; both are allowed now in defence of Ukraine. On this view, Republican demands for more vigorous military action by the administration would have the sanction of international law. That may not be true of Chinese assistance to Russia. American officials have claimed that China is contemplating providing arms to Russia. But since Russia is the aggressor, China cannot say it is helping on the basis of “collective self-defence”. Indeed, if it sells munitions to Russia knowing they are likely to be used against civilians, it would be colluding in a war crime. In practice, of course, Russia claims—absurdly—that Ukraine is the aggressor, and that Russia invaded it to prevent the genocide of Ukraine’s Russian-speaking minority, a view that has been rejected by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN’s judicial arm. China could argue that it is simply helping Russia defend itself. The big questions, however, concern Ukraine’s Western allies. More military assistance might be justified legally. Would it make sense more broadly? And would Western countries be willing to accept the unpredictable consequences of giving more military support? Although Vladimir Putin has already declared the West’s sanctions on Russia “akin to an act of war”, he has not behaved as if he believes it. His foreign ministry has announced that weapons convoys from NATO countries are “legitimate targets”. But where he might hit them—inside Ukraine or across the Polish border—could make a world of difference.NATO has suggested there should indeed be limits on how involved other countries get in the war in Ukraine. It has, for example, been willing to provide anti-tank missiles to Ukraine but has rejected the Ukrainian government’s request that it send fighter jets as too provocative and has turned a deaf ear to insistent demands for a no-fly zone. These decisions are based on a calculation of how Mr Putin might react. The alliance does not wish to give the Russian president even the flimsiest of excuses to widen the conflict and “retaliate”.Whatever the legal position, there is no easy way to enforce the rules enshrined in the UN charter, especially since Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, can veto almost any action the UN might take. Russia is shrugging off proceedings against it at the ICJ, which has ordered it to cease attacks and withdraw its forces. It shows little concern for the Geneva Conventions, treaties to which it is party and which provide protections for civilians in war zones. It is this brutish conduct, in practice, that limits Western help for Ukraine and constrains the American administration: NATO governments do not want to enrage an adversary with so few qualms about how it behaves.The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
87,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is under new management,,11/04/22,"AS THE RUSSIAN invasion of Ukraine stalled in February and March, Western officials scoured the intelligence to work out who was in charge. No one, it seemed. Russia had attacked Ukraine from several axes in the north, east and south. Each of those forces was fighting—and in some cases, losing—its own war. As Russia abandons its assault on Kyiv for now and focuses instead on the Donbas region and the rest of eastern Ukraine, it is learning from its mistakes. On April 8th a Western official told The Economist and other news organisations that General Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia’s southern military district, had been put in charge of operations in Ukraine. Who is he? General Dvornikov was born in Ussuriysk, a city near the Chinese border in Russia’s far east, in 1961. He graduated from the local military school as a teenager and rose through the ranks in what was then called Russia’s Far Eastern military district, whose main task was to guard against Chinese attack. Like Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, he served in East Germany, leaving with the last Russian forces in 1994. He also fought in the exceptionally brutal second Chechen war at the turn of the millennium. “He accomplished everything smoothly and with hard work, was never anyone’s protégé and moved up the ranks with great difficulty,” a military source told Russian state media in 2016. He was later appointed deputy commander of the Eastern district and then chief of staff of the Central one, which has responsibility for Central Asia.That led to a career-making posting. In 2015 General Dvornikov became the first commander of Russia’s military campaign in support of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s dictator. The idea of a small but decisive projection of military power a long way beyond the country’s borders, using air, ground and naval forces, was a novelty for Russia. “The Syrian armed forces had completely exhausted themselves, the personnel were demoralised [and] the officer corps was degraded,” recalled General Dvornikov, years later. Russian involvement “radically changed the situation”. His success in turning the situation around and rescuing Mr Assad’s regime earned him the Kremlin’s approbation: in 2016 he was made a Hero of the Russian Federation, the country’s highest honour. He also bagged an appointment as commander of the Southern military district. The district is small, but strategic: it abuts Donbas, where Russian forces and their proxies have fought Ukraine since 2014, and where the next phase of the current war is likely to play out. It was this command, and his consequent knowledge of the area, that probably led to his appointment as the point man for Ukraine. That command also put him on a British sanctions list: he is alleged to have overseen air support for a Russian attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in 2018, which helped Russia consolidate its occupation of Crimea. More troubling still was the conduct of the forces he commanded in Syria. During his first three months in charge, Russian air strikes were estimated to have killed almost 700 members of Islamic State, a jihadist group—but almost 800 civilians, too. Human-rights bodies accuse Russia of using cluster munitions in built-up areas and deliberately striking hospitals around Aleppo, a rebel-held city. In 2020 Human Rights Watch, an NGO, cited General Dvornikov’s Hero of the Russian Federation award as evidence of the “lack of accountability” in Russia’s war. Heavy civilian casualties were an inevitable byproduct of the strategy General Dvornikov adopted in Syria. In an article published in 2018, he pointed to the difficulty of fighting in mountains, in tunnels under cities and night operations. Firepower was key, he said: air strikes, missiles fired from warships, artillery and, in Aleppo, “constant fire…day and night, without a break”. Psychological warfare was important, too: “without information operations, we would not have been successful in Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor and Ghouta,” said General Dvornikov, referring to urban areas that were all but levelled. Ironically, given Russia’s woes in Ukraine, the paramount lesson was the importance of unified command. General Dvornikov ran the war from Russia’s headquarters in Khmeimim, an airbase in western Syria, with 15-20 staff. Khmeimim “linked all the elements into a single reconnaissance and strike” system, he noted later. Commanders could talk to one another by video link. Naval officers could co-ordinate strikes by aircraft-carriers against ground targets. Decisions were made quickly. General Dvornikov is not the only one with this experience. Almost every senior Russian officer has spent time in Syria. Alexander Zhuravlyov and Alexander Chayko, the generals who command Russia’s Western and Eastern military districts respectively, have both commanded Syrian operations twice and have spent longer there than General Dvornikov, notes Rob Lee of King’s College London. But General Dvornikov is “very thoughtful” and “listens to others, contrary to many Russian generals of his rank and generation”, says a source who has met him. He is said to have impressed German officials during a visit to the country some years ago. A capacity to learn will be vital for Russia’s armed forces. “The Kremlin identifies Syria as a highly successful—and replicable—operation,” concluded a study published by the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, last year. That it was not replicated in Ukraine is probably down to several pathologies: the secrecy with which the Kremlin planned the war, faulty intelligence about Ukraine’s fragility and its will to resist, and the vastly bigger scale of the operation.Yet the fragmented command structure will have played a role, too. “There is an expectation that their operations will be far better co-ordinated than they were previously,” says the Western official. “We are yet to see evidence of that in terms of what they’re doing, but…we would expect command and control to improve.” General Dvornikov cannot fix everything—morale remains low, officials say, with some Russian units refusing to fight, and manpower is still an issue too—but the coming weeks will show whether he can get the Russian war machine back on track. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThe West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
88,How big is Russia’s military build-up around Ukraine?,,31/01/22,"THE CRISIS on the Russia-Ukraine border continues to simmer. On February 5th American officials warned that Russia had gathered 70% of the forces that would be necessary for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A war “could happen as soon as tomorrow”, warned Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, a day later. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, visited Moscow on February 7th as part of a diplomatic blitz to stop it. But how large and unusual is Russia’s build-up?To grasp its scale, it is necessary to understand the currency of modern Russian deployments: the battalion tactical group, or BTG, a fighting formation of 600 to 1,000 troops equipped with their own artillery, air defence and logistics. During the worst fighting of the Russia-Ukraine war, in 2015, Russia sent no more than a dozen BTGs. By February 4th it had 83 in place near the border, with 14 more in transit, according to American officials, who reckon the final figure will be 120 or so. A good chunk of those are in Belarus. On February 3rd Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, said that he expected 30,000 Russian troops to be sent there. In total, elements of ten out of the country’s eleven Combined Arms Armies—a high-level formation that typically contains several divisions—are now near Ukraine, says Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, who tracks Russian military movements. Moreover, the BTG-count excludes air and naval forces, as well as VDV units, or paratroopers, who are now available after a brief jaunt in Kazakhstan earlier this month. Add them all up, and Russia probably has more than 130,000 troops in place. Although this is not at the scale of the Warsaw Pact’s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which involved more than a quarter of a million troops, it matches the scale of the largest peacetime exercises held by the Soviet Union or NATO during the cold war, and far surpasses the first and second Chechen wars, which began in 1994 and 1999 respectively. Though Operation Storm, a Croatian offensive against Serbia in 1995, was larger, Russian forces today are far better armed. This is probably the largest accretion of firepower seen in Europe for 40 years. Nor is it confined to land. Warships from all four of Russia’s naval fleets—the Baltic, Black Sea, Northern and Pacific Fleets—have converged on the Mediterranean. On February 4th Russia’s defence ministry said that more than 90 of its submarines and ships were at sea the previous week. Two Russian guided-missile cruisers—particularly well-armed warships—are thought to be in the Mediterranean, with a third in the Black Sea. Russia has given Turkey notice that six landing craft will cross the Bosphorus strait from the Mediterranean into the Black Sea between February 8th and 9th, which would allow an amphibious assault on the Ukrainian coast. In recent days, there are signs that the build-up on land has entered a more advanced and worrying stage. Videos on social media and satellite images from early February show that Russia’s 41st Combined Arms Army has been leaving Yelnya, a large camp, and moving south to smaller locations very close to the Ukrainian border. Troops are also moving into place. Satellite images show new tents sprouting up at bases in western Russia and Belarus, and snow melting on the roof of barracks that have had their heating turned on. Troops from Russia’s Rosgvardia, or national guard, who would be necessary to support any occupation of Ukrainian territory, have also been seen moving by road and rail. There are other red flags, too. Military planners divide combat forces into “teeth” (crudely, things with guns) and “tail” (the things that support them). Soldiers and tanks are of no use if they cannot be kept fuelled, armed and on the move. Petri Mäkelä, a Finnish military analyst, points to examples of several such enablers being prepared or moved, such as long-range radar sets, radio relay systems and spare missiles for offensive launchers and air-defence systems. Russian “pipeline troops”, which rapidly refuel mechanised forces, and can lay up to 80km of pipeline a day, have been seen in Krasnodar, close to Crimea. American officials have said that Russia has moved blood supplies closer to the Ukrainian border. Janes, a defence-intelligence firm, says that the “final indicators” of an offensive would probably include the activation of paratroopers, transport planes to move troops and the large-scale movement of warplanes to air bases near the border. There are early signs of all three things. Large amounts of equipment belonging to VDV, Russia’s airborne forces, have been spotted in Belarus, and Su-25 ground attack jets are visible at Luninets air base in Belarus—50km from the border with Ukraine. Most striking of all, perhaps, is that Russia has activated units from every corner of its territory. Even the Eastern Military District, an administrative zone that stretches to the North Korean border, has been virtually emptied out, with most of its forces sent to Belarus. “Not since 1922 have there been so few forces on the border with Mongolia and China,” observes Alexei Karpychev, a Russian military analyst—not even, he notes, in the “hardest year” of 1941, when Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. ■Editor’s note (February 7th 2022): This piece has been updated with Russia’s latest deployments.For more stories on the potential for, and possible impact of, conflict in eastern Europe, visit our hubThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
89,The Kremlin escalates its war on truth,,30/03/23,"ON MARCH 29TH Evan Gershkovich, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, disappeared during a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-biggest city. The following day Russian security services came clean: they had arrested him on charges of espionage. That Mr Gershkovich, an American citizen, is accredited to report in Russia seems to have made little difference. The arrest is likely to exacerbate the already-terrible relations between Russia and America.Social-media accounts suggested that Mr Gershkovich was removed from the Bukowski Grill, a restaurant in Yekaterinburg, by plain-clothed men who led him out with a sweatshirt over his head. He has not been seen in public since. The Wall Street Journal said it was “deeply concerned” for its reporter’s safety. Mr Gershkovich was in Yekaterinburg to report on the recruitment of female convicts into Wagner, a private mercenary company fighting in eastern Ukraine. It was his second recent trip to the city. A local public-relations executive who helped arrange his meetings on the first visit said he had taken Mr Gershkovich for lunch at the same restaurant. “It’s not difficult to imagine that someone might visit familiar places in an unfamiliar city.” It is understood that on another occasion Mr Gershkovich visited Nizhny Tagil, a city near Yekaterinburg where Russia’s largest tank factory is located. The FSB, Russia’s main security agency, said it had detained Mr Gershkovich after he allegedly “collected secret information about a factory in Russia’s military-industrial complex.” Charges under article 276 of the criminal code, under which Mr Gershkovich appears to be held, carry prison terms of up to 20 years. A social-media account connected to the FSB that regularly breaks news of its operations added that the bureau is collecting assets in preparation for an exchange of prisoners. Last week America announced charges against Sergei Cherkasov, a Russian citizen arrested in the Netherlands last year while working under a Brazilian alias. In December the Biden administration agreed to exchange Viktor Bout, a convicted arms dealer imprisoned in America, for Brittney Griner, a basketball star who had spent almost ten months in a Russian jail on drugs charges. Although Mr Gershkovich was detained in Yekaterinburg, his case is being handled by a unit of the central FSB. State media reports suggested that he had been transferred to the infamous high-security Lefortovo jail, which the FSB uses for espionage cases. A judge at a closed sitting ruled that he should be kept there until at least May 29th.Russia’s leadership was almost certainly aware of the plans. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, claimed that Mr Gershkovich had been caught “red-handed,” though declined to offer details. He added that the Kremlin “monitors” Western media and was “acquainted” with Mr Gershkovich’s work. “This is the prerogative of the FSB. This is what the FSB are saying. We don’t have anything else to add.” Already highly restrictive, Russia’s reporting laws were tightened further after the invasion of Ukraine. At least theoretically, broad swathes of legitimate reporting now border on criminal activity. The aim of the laws is to inspire fear, intimidating the press and citizens from spreading accurate information about the dwindling prospects of Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation”, as journalists are obliged to describe the war. The arrest of an American citizen working for one of the world’s most reputable media organisations is an escalation in Mr Putin’s war on the truth. ■The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
90,"Talks between Russia and Ukraine would save lives, argues Christopher Chivvis",,29/01/23,"ON FEBRUARY 24TH, the war in Ukraine will pass its one-year mark with no end in sight. The costs are mounting, Europe faces an epic refugee crisis, tens of thousands of people have died and total casualties now run into the hundreds of thousands. Plans to provide Ukraine with Western tanks, announced in recent days, indicate that America, Germany and others are settling in for a much longer war. But in a prolonged conflict, far more will perish. Western leaders would be making a big mistake by not pushing for negotiations to end the fighting, even as they continue to support Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has said he favours peace talks—but only after Ukraine wins back important territory. He wants to reclaim not only what Ukraine lost in 2022, but also what it lost in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and occupied parts of the Donbas region. I sympathise with Ukraine’s desire to fight on until it drives Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory. I’m sure Ukrainian leaders worry that peace talks will demoralise their troops, who are fighting so bravely. Their cause is just. But their war aims are unrealistic. Western tanks are a symbol of commitment and they will eventually improve Ukraine’s chances of piercing Russian fortifications. But they are not a game changer.With luck the tanks may encourage Vladimir Putin to consider negotiations seriously. But he still cannot afford to retreat with nothing to show for his war, however deplorable it is. Given how much he has staked on this operation, its failure—let alone a larger loss that includes Crimea or other territory Russia took in 2014—would risk a revolt from inside Russia’s elites that destabilises his regime. This is also a deeply personal crusade for Mr Putin who probably sees it as the dénouement of his long reign.Ukraine’s war aims also look unrealistic because Mr Putin is not about to run out of money. China supports him politically and buys Russian oil and gas. And sanctions haven’t crippled the Russian economy as initially hoped. His troops are still being paid and the Russian army is dug in. Its trenches can be seen from satellite photographs, weaving out like threads along the frontlines in the east and the south. Mr Putin has also called up a large reserve army and discovered new ways to restock Russia’s arsenal. (The Kremlin has figured how to produce KH-101 cruise missiles domestically in spite of sanctions and has bought weapons from Iran and North Korea.)Ukraine cannot achieve its grandest objectives without an even greater increase in support from the West. This is why it has asked not only for tanks, but also F-16 fighter aircraft, Grey Eagle drones, ATACM long-range missiles and cluster munitions. Perhaps an enduring conflict would see Ukraine seize back the Donbas region; but it could also see renewed assaults on Kyiv. The West, however, lacks the vital interest that would justify the escalation risks, military, political and human costs entailed by supporting Ukraine’s grandest aims.In America Congress has already voted for over $100bn in military, financial and other support to Ukraine. But public support for such measures is fading. A poll published in December from the Chicago council, an American think-tank, found that the share of Americans who believe that Washington should support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” dropped to 48%, down from 58% in July. And the differences between NATO allies over how far to proceed in the war will remain.For everyone, the risk of escalation into a broader, more destructive war will also persist as long as the fighting does. A long conflict is sure to eat up scarce European resources, prevent millions of refugees from returning home and weaken the economic climate. Mr Putin’s nuclear sabre-rattling is condemnable and self-serving, but a responsible approach to the war means taking the possibility seriously that he will use nuclear weapons. There is just too much to lose. That is why a much more robust diplomatic track is needed, even as we keep up the pressure on Russia globally.Those who favour continuing the war perhaps believe there is a military alternative to negotiation that resolves the underlying conflict between Russia and Ukraine. There is not. Yes, it would be nice if Ukraine clawed back some more territory. But at what cost and for what strategic gain? Even in the unlikely event that the West were to back Ukraine to the hilt for many years and were eventually to force Russia out of all Ukrainian territory, Russia would probably restart the war at some point to salvage its lost gains and its reputation. A regime-change operation in Moscow might prevent this, but it would be wildly risky.Getting diplomacy going will require tough conversations to persuade Ukraine to adopt a more realistic approach to its war aims. Western tanks for Ukraine will make this more difficult, but they also strengthen the West’s ability—and its right—to do so. After all, America already limits Ukraine’s use of its weapons in several ways, for example, by prohibiting strikes into Russia. Meanwhile, greater public openness to negotiations among Western leaders might help Mr Zelensky make the case to his own citizens and security services. And Western military support should continue alongside—deterrence and détente can be complementary.Mr Putin is an autocrat with an axe to grind about NATO. Whether or not he would enter talks with any seriousness is unknown. But the decision to send tanks may encourage him to do so. Concern that a negotiated settlement would “reward” Mr Putin, and perhaps encourage Chinese aggression in Taiwan, is overblown. If the negotiations froze the battlelines where they are now, Mr Putin would have paid a very high price for very limited gains. His armed forces have displayed their incompetence to the whole world. Russia is now a pariah state and its relationship with Europe—for centuries its most important—is destroyed. Sanctions will slow Russia’s economic growth for years to come, even if they are eventually moderated in return for concessions from the Kremlin.Many critics of negotiations object to the idea of diplomacy with a man like Mr Putin on principle, but Western powers should and do regularly negotiate with adversaries, including contemptible ones, when it serves national interests and prevents violence and human suffering. At first, negotiations wouldn’t seek to settle the conflict once and for all, much less resolve Russia’s litany of gripes about NATO. Diplomats would have to aim low at first, starting with limited ceasefires and transparency measures. The arrangement brokered in July to allow Ukrainian grain exports indicates that negotiations on specific problems can work. If a ceasefire held, broader negotiations over deeper differences could then take place later on. Even a temporary end to the fighting would offer a chance for emotions to cool, lives to be saved and resources spared.Talks also offer promise of post-conflict reconstruction. And that is where Ukraine’s true victory over Russia will lie: in becoming a vibrant democracy well integrated into Europe. That process, already likely to last until the 2030s, could stretch out for many years more if the war continues, judging by historical precedents in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.Negotiations might fail outright, but the parties who would be involved in them cannot really know until they try. Talks could also succeed initially but produce a peace that collapses in a few years—like the Minsk accords that ended the 2014 war. Although imperfect, even this outcome would be better than several years of more fighting. Another frozen conflict is preferable to a never-ending war that puts Europe, Ukraine and ultimately the world at risk for years to come.■_______________Christopher S.

91,How Russia is conscripting men to fight in Ukraine,,24/09/22,"RUSSIAN FORCES have suffered huge losses in Ukraine. So Vladimir Putin has ordered a “partial mobilisation” to beef up his invasion force. This is causing widespread protests in Russia, and panic among young men who do not want to die for Mr Putin’s imperial dream. Many are trying to leave Russia. Queues at borders with Georgia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia stretched for several kilometres. The exodus could prove even larger than the one at the beginning of the war, when about 300,000 mostly young Russians fled. The Economist spoke to several men in St Petersburg about the prospect of conscription. “We have fallen into hell—that’s how I see it,” said one. Another hoped his poor eyesight would spare him from the draft. How does conscription work in Russia, and how will this mobilisation affect the country and its armed forces?Russia has always had conscription. Its armed forces consist of a core of professional soldiers, complemented by conscripts and reservists (usually former recruits who can choose to take up lucrative short-term military contracts or be called up in times of need). Nearly all healthy men aged 18 to 27 are eligible, roughly 1.2m people at any given time. Around half of those men are called to attend a district voyenkomat (military recruitment centre) during two annual drafting periods. There they undertake interviews and physical tests to ascertain their fitness for service. Each year the armed forces choose about 250,000 recruits, who typically serve for 12 months before joining the reserves.Conscripts endure bleak conditions with meagre pay and a tradition of hazing, known as dedovshchina. Many Russians go to great lengths to avoid being called up. Exemptions can be granted for health reasons and for university study. Another way to dodge the draft is to bribe someone. Recruiters and medics will often fake exemptions for the right price. Many middle-class Russians pay up. For the poor it is obviously harder, which is one reason why Russia’s armed forces are disproportionately manned by people from poorer regions, and why a disproportionate number of those killed in Ukraine have been from ethnic minorities. Announcing a national mobilisation is very unusual. The Kremlin last did it when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. It allows reservists to be called up to support the armed forces. Experts estimate that Russia has about 2m of those in total. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, says that 300,000 may be deployed during this “partial mobilisation”. However, parts of the mobilisation act are secret. Novaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper, reports that it in fact allows for 1m people to be enlisted. Meduza, another independent outlet, says it could be up to 1.2m.Reports have emerged of men receiving conscription papers en masse, especially in poorer areas in the east and south of the country such as Chechnya and Dagestan. In Buryatia, an ethnic-Mongolian region in eastern Siberia, men were handed draft papers in the middle of the night, regardless of their experience or profession. According to Alexandra Garmazhapova of the Free Buryatia Foundation, an anti-war group, people were drafted within minutes of Mr Putin’s speech. “They are pulling in everyone⁠—it is a general mobilisation, 100%,” she was quoted as saying by Republic, a Russian online publication. “Nobody will get away, nobody will hide, nobody will get forgotten,” an official at a military commission is heard saying in a video from Omsk, Siberia, published by Dozhd, an independent television channel now operating from abroad. Reservists in Tatarstan have been banned from leaving the region, and rumours abound that officials are working on ways to sign up migrants from Central Asia.However, it is unlikely that the government can actually round up 1m soldiers. A campaign last spring intended to draft 134,000 yielded just 89,000. Mr Putin has given his press gangs additional legal tools—refusing to be drafted is now a criminal offence. But it is far from clear that he has the means to compel 1m men to fight against their will. If he can call up hundreds of thousands, that would surely help his war effort in the medium term. But conscripted civilians do not necessarily make good soldiers. According to RAND, a think-tank, many of Russia’s reservists lack military training sufficient or recent enough to be effective fighters. Experts suggest that training could take months. Yet in one recent video, officers can be heard telling newly mobilised recruits that they will get just two weeks of training before being sent to Ukraine.Mr Putin’s strategy smacks of desperation. It is wildly unpopular among Russians, who previously tolerated his war on the understanding that it would not affect their lives much. Before mobilisation was announced, an independent poll found that two-thirds of Russians were against it. Thus, in an effort to avoid defeat on the battlefield, Russia’s despot risks dramatically undermining support for his regime. ■More from The Economist explains:Do Russia’s military setbacks increase the risk of nuclear conflict?What are HARM, the air-to-surface missiles destroying Russian air-defence radar?Why Azerbaijan and Armenia are fighting againThe Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies—and was never fully repealedFor the first time in recorded history, China will not be the world’s biggest countryTime is on his side, for now"
92,A Russian warlord’s savagery is sending a loud message to Moscow,,04/01/23,"THE LINE between life and death on the muddy hillocks south of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, is thin. For Yaroslav Hervolsky, a soldier in a Ukrainian evacuation brigade, it can be indistinguishable. For two-and-a-half months now, Mr Hervolsky has headed under artillery fire into the mud to retrieve colleagues, dead or alive. The job has offered little respite. In mid-December a successful Ukrainian surge pushed Russian forces back a kilometre beyond the boundaries of the town. But it made little difference to Mr Hervolsky’s workload, with Ukrainian losses continuing at the level of dozens daily. Now the Russians are attacking again, and the bodies are piling up. “It’s hard to describe the feeling,” he says. “Forty bodies stacked up on top of one another. Diesel, blood and rotting flesh. It’s a fucking mess, and you never know if you will be next.”Your browser does not support the <audio> element.The front line near Bakhmut, a small and tired town 70km (43 miles) north of the city of Donetsk, is currently the most fiercely contested section in Ukraine. It offers little justification for the deaths of so many, which have been running at hundreds daily when Russian losses are included. The town has only limited strategic value, offering little but a source of water and a road-transport hub. Its real significance lies far away in Moscow, as a proving ground for President Vladimir Putin’s associate Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, his shadowy mercenary army. Recruiting from convicts and mobilised soldiers, Mr Prigozhin has taken command of the Bakhmut front, and is using it to demonstrate his own bloody vision of the future. But far from everyone in Moscow is happy, not least the military and political leaders whom the warlord has taken to criticising openly. The extent of collaboration between Wagner and the Russian armed forces was for a long time unclear. But Wagner found a way of co-operating with Russia’s military hierarchy in late autumn. According to Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern command, this moment coincided with the appointment of a new operational commander, General Sergei Surovikin, a hardliner whose candidacy Mr Prigozhin had lobbied for. Wagner started to be supported by the regular military logistical network, says the spokesman, and even began to fight alongside elite units of the regular Russian army in strike groups. But recent reverses near Bakhmut and problems with logistics appear to have strained the relationship once again.In late December Wagner released a video showing two of its fighters voicing a staggering attack on the commander-in-chief of Russia’s armed forces, General Valery Gerasimov. The soldiers, who concealed their identities with scarves but appeared to be fighting near Bakhmut, claimed that Russia’s top soldier was holding back munitions. “We are fighting the entire Ukrainian army, and where are you? There’s only one word to describe what you are—a faggot.” Loyalists condemned the outburst. But Mr Prigozhin later made a point of publicly backing his men. A Ukrainian missile attack on a barracks in Makiivka, 60km from Bakhmut, on New Year’s Day has fuelled yet more nationalist criticism of the Russian military leadership. The early-morning strike, courtesy of at least four Western-supplied HIMARS high-precision missiles, killed scores of (mostly newly mobilised) soldiers. Russia has said that 89 died; Ukraine says the figure is at least 400. Igor “Strelkov” Girkin, the eccentric former intelligence officer largely responsible for the outbreak of war in the Donbas region in 2014, said he had warned Russian generals about the likelihood of HIMARS strikes on barracks. “They [the generals] are untrainable in principle,” he barked. Some in Russia have sought to blame the new recruits for their own demise, speculating that Ukraine was able to identify the barracks because the soldiers were, against orders, using their mobile phones. Mr Girkin has a solid following among nationalists, but officials in Moscow are far more worried about the continued rise of Mr Prigozhin’s star. That concern intensified in October and November, says Tatyana Stanovaya, a political analyst in Moscow, when people in the presidential administration saw the former convict establish a direct channel to Mr Putin. “Prigozhin is attacking governmental institutions with what amount to revolutionary positions, and that is frightening for many of them.” The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, himself a regular target for Wagner’s criticism, appears to be taking few chances, and has sent his own mercenary grouping, Patriot, to fight in the Donbas. Ukraine’s spokesman Mr Cherevaty says the exact role the Patriot force will play is unclear. “It seems likely, however, that they have been sent to counterbalance Wagner.” In recent speeches, Mr Putin has underlined the primacy of the regular military leadership. But he appears unconcerned by the dangers of Mr Prigozhin’s uncompromising alternative, says Ms Stanovaya. “Putin sees him as someone able to rouse the nation, and as a representative of some strange civil society.” For the time being, the ex-convict remains firmly in Mr Putin’s orbit. But if Mr Putin was once seen as invulnerable, persistent rumours that he has cancer and doubts about his military judgment mean that is no longer the case. If the position on the battlefield gets significantly worse, a power struggle could break out.The more immediate response to Russia’s serious and deepening military problems in Ukraine, however, is likely to be a new wave of mobilisation. Ukraine believes that this could start within days; its defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, suggested last week that it could be accompanied by the announcement of martial law. Bakhmut seems certain to bear the brunt of any increase in numbers, as it already has done for months. “One day they are in disarray, the next they are replenishing, that’s always been the rule,” says Mr Hervolsky. “We struggle on. But there seems to be no limit to the amount of shit they can throw at Bakhmut.” ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Hills to die on?""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
93,Yuval Noah Harari argues that what’s at stake in Ukraine is the direction of human history,,09/02/22,"By Yuval Noah HarariThis article is part of our Summer reads series, which also includes:* Lithuania’s prime minister on the predictability of Russia’s invasion* A young Afghan woman on breaking free of the burqa* Herman Narula on why the metaverse mattersAT THE HEART of the Ukraine crisis lies a fundamental question about the nature of history and the nature of humanity: is change possible? Can humans change the way they behave, or does history repeat itself endlessly, with humans forever condemned to re-enact past tragedies without changing anything except the décor? One school of thought firmly denies the possibility of change. It argues that the world is a jungle, that the strong prey upon the weak and that the only thing preventing one country from wolfing down another is military force. This is how it always was, and this is how it always will be. Those who don’t believe in the law of the jungle are not just deluding themselves, but are putting their very existence at risk. They will not survive long.Another school of thought argues that the so-called law of the jungle isn’t a natural law at all. Humans made it, and humans can change it. Contrary to popular misconceptions, the first clear evidence for organised warfare appears in the archaeological record only 13,000 years ago. Even after that date there have been many periods devoid of archaeological evidence for war. Unlike gravity, war isn’t a fundamental force of nature. Its intensity and existence depend on underlying technological, economic and cultural factors. As these factors change, so does war.Evidence of such change is all around us. Over the past few generations, nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, forcing the most powerful nations on Earth to find less violent ways to resolve conflict. Whereas great-power wars, such as the second Punic war or the second world war, have been a salient feature for much of history, in the past seven decades there has been no direct war between superpowers.During the same period, the global economy has been transformed from one based on materials to one based on knowledge. Where once the main sources of wealth were material assets such as gold mines, wheat fields and oil wells, today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can seize oil fields by force, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. The profitability of conquest has declined as a result. Finally, a tectonic shift has taken place in global culture. Many elites in history—Hun chieftains, Viking jarls and Roman patricians, for example—viewed war positively. Rulers from Sargon the Great to Benito Mussolini sought to immortalise themselves by conquest (and artists such as Homer and Shakespeare happily obliged such fancies). Other elites, such as the Christian church, viewed war as evil but inevitable. In the past few generations, however, for the first time in history the world became dominated by elites who see war as both evil and avoidable. Even the likes of George W. Bush and Donald Trump, not to mention the Merkels and Arderns of the world, are very different types of politicians than Attila the Hun or Alaric the Goth. They usually come to power with dreams of domestic reforms rather than foreign conquests. While in the realm of art and thought, most of the leading lights —from Pablo Picasso to Stanley Kubrick—are better known for depicting the senseless horrors of combat than for glorifying its architects.As a result of all these changes, most governments stopped seeing wars of aggression as an acceptable tool to advance their interests, and most nations stopped fantasising about conquering and annexing their neighbours. It is simply not true that military force alone prevents Brazil from conquering Uruguay or prevents Spain from invading Morocco.The decline of war is evident in numerous statistics. Since 1945, it has become relatively rare for international borders to be redrawn by foreign invasion, and not a single internationally recognised country has been completely wiped off the map by external conquest. There has been no shortage of other types of conflicts, such as civil wars and insurgencies. But even when taking all types of conflict into account, in the first two decades of the 21st century human violence has killed fewer people than suicide, car accidents or obesity-related diseases. Gunpowder has become less lethal than sugar. Scholars argue back and forth about the exact statistics, but it is important to look beyond the maths. The decline of war has been a psychological as well as statistical phenomenon. Its most important feature has been a major change in the very meaning of the term “peace”. For most of history peace meant only “the temporary absence of war”. When people in 1913 said that there was peace between France and Germany, they meant that the French and German armies were not clashing directly, but everybody knew that a war between them might nevertheless erupt at any moment. In recent decades “peace” has come to mean “the implausibility of war”. For many countries, being invaded and conquered by the neighbours has become almost inconceivable. I live in the Middle East, so I know perfectly well that there are exceptions to these trends. But recognising the trends is at least as important as being able to point out the exceptions. The “new peace” hasn’t been a statistical fluke or hippie fantasy. It has been reflected most clearly in coldly-calculated budgets. In recent decades governments around the world have felt safe enough to spend an average of only about 6.5% of their budgets on their armed forces, while spending far more on education, health care and welfare. We tend to take it for granted, but it is an astonishing novelty in human history. For thousands of years, military expenditure was by far the biggest item on the budget of every prince, khan, sultan and emperor. They hardly spent a penny on education or medical help for the masses. The decline of war didn’t result from a divine miracle or from a change in the laws of nature. It resulted from humans making better choices. It is arguably the greatest political and moral achievement of modern civilisation. Unfortunately, the fact that it stems from human choice also means that it is reversible. Technology, economics and culture continue to change. The rise of cyber weapons, AI-driven economies and newly militaristic cultures could result in a new era of war, worse than anything we have seen before. To enjoy peace, we need almost everyone to make good choices. By contrast, a poor choice by just one side can lead to war. This is why the Russian threat to invade Ukraine should concern every person on Earth. If it again becomes normative for powerful countries to wolf down their weaker neighbours, it would affect the way people all over the world feel and behave. The first and most obvious result of a return to the law of the jungle would be a sharp increase in military spending at the expense of everything else. The money that should go to teachers, nurses and social workers would instead go to tanks, missiles and cyber weapons.A return to the jungle would also undermine global co-operation on problems such as preventing catastrophic climate change or regulating disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. It isn’t easy to work alongside countries that are preparing to eliminate you. And as both climate change and an AI arms race accelerate, the threat of armed conflict will only increase further, closing a vicious circle that may well doom our species. If you believe that historic change is impossible, and that humanity never left the jungle and never will, the only choice left is whether to play the part of predator or prey. Given such a choice, most leaders would prefer to go down in history as alpha predators, and add their names to the grim list of conquerors that unfortunate pupils are condemned to memorize for their history exams. But maybe change is possible? Maybe the law of the jungle is a choice rather than an inevitability? If so, any leader who chooses to conquer a neighbour will get a special place in humanity’s memory, far worse than your run-of-the-mill Tamerlane. He will go down in history as the man who ruined our greatest achievement. Just when we thought we were out of the jungle, he pulled us back in. I don’t know what will happen in Ukraine. But as a historian I do believe in the possibility of change. I don’t think this is naivety—it’s realism. The only constant of human history is change. And that’s something that perhaps we can learn from the Ukrainians. For many generations, Ukrainians knew little but tyranny and violence. They endured two centuries of tsarist autocracy (which finally collapsed amidst the cataclysm of the first world war). A brief attempt at independence was quickly crushed by the Red Army that re-established Russian rule. Ukrainians then lived through the terrible man-made famine of the Holodomor, Stalinist terror, Nazi occupation and decades of soul-crushing Communist dictatorship. When the Soviet Union collapsed, history seemed to guarantee that Ukrainians would again go down the path of brutal tyranny – what else did they know? But they chose differently. Despite history, despite grinding poverty and despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Ukrainians established a democracy. In Ukraine, unlike in Russia and Belarus, opposition candidates repeatedly replaced incumbents. When faced with the threat of autocracy in 2004 and 2013, Ukrainians twice rose in revolt to defend their freedom. Their democracy is a new thing. So is the “new peace”. Both are fragile, and may not last long. But both are possible, and may strike deep roots. Every old thing was once new. It all comes down to human choices.■Copyright © Yuval Noah Harari 2022._______________Yuval Noah Harari is a historian, philosopher and author of “Sapiens” (2014), “Homo Deus” (2016) and the series “Sapiens: A Graphic History” (2020-21).

94,The world’s deadliest war last year wasn’t in Ukraine,,17/04/23,"Fighter jets roar over Khartoum. Bombs rattle the Sudanese capital. Many civilians, sheltering from what may be the start of a civil war, wonder: “why?”Your browser does not support the <audio> element.It is tempting, and correct, to blame individuals. A conflict cannot erupt unless someone starts fighting, and Sudan has two conspicuous villains. The army’s head is battling a militia boss for control of Africa’s third-largest country. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s de facto ruler, runs a military junta that keeps delaying a promised handover of power to civilians. Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as “Hemedti”), leads paramilitaries called the Rapid Support Forces, which in an earlier guise committed genocide in Darfur. Both sides have the kind of ambition that often leads to bloodshed in countries with few checks and balances. They crave unaccountable power and the perks that come with it. The army already has a vast, shady business empire; Hemedti has reportedly made a fortune from gold mines and selling military services abroad. Neither man seems willing to share power. Each calls the other a “criminal”.Yet Sudan’s misfortunes are not simply the fault of these two odious men. The country has been tormented by civil war for most of the time since independence in 1956. It is an example of a global problem: the increasing persistence of conflict. As attention is focused on great-power rivalry between America, Russia and China, conflicts in the rest of the world are getting worse. The number of people who have been forced to flee their homes has doubled in the past decade, to roughly 100m. Even as global poverty has retreated, the number of desperate people needing emergency aid has doubled since 2020, to 340m. Some 80% of this is driven by conflict, estimates the International Rescue Committee (irc), an ngo. Since 1945, conflicts have come in three overlapping waves. First, people in European colonies struggled for independence. Then, rival groups fought for control of these newly independent states. The cold war raised the stakes: the West backed insurgencies against governments that professed to be Marxist, from Angola to Nicaragua. The Soviet Union supported anti-capitalist guerrillas and revolutionary regimes on every continent. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the number of wars fell sharply. So, too, did the estimated number of deaths in battle. But after 2011 came a third wave. Both the number of wars and their deadliness increased, as the Arab spring led to conflagrations in the Middle East, a new form of jihadism spread across the Muslim world and Vladimir Putin resurrected old-fashioned Russian imperialism. Mr Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unusual: a straightforward attempt by one state to conquer another and steal its territory. Most modern armed conflicts are harder to understand. They are usually civil wars, though many involve foreign meddling. They are largely in poor countries, especially hot ones like Sudan. (Indeed, they form a belt of pain around the equator—see map) They cause millions of deaths, but exactly how many is hard to estimate. Far more perish from war-induced hunger or disease than from bullets or shrapnel. Fighting makes poor places rapidly poorer. A typical five-year civil war reduces income per head by a fifth, estimates Christopher Blattman of the University of Chicago in his book “Why We Fight”. So it is alarming that wars are lasting longer (see chart 1). The average ongoing conflict in the mid-1980s had been happening for about 13 years; by 2021 it was nearly 20 years. There are several plausible reasons for this. First, global norms are eroding. When Russia, a permanent member of the un Security Council (unsc), brazenly violated the un’s founding charter by invading Ukraine, murdering civilians and kidnapping children, it showed how much taboos have weakened. When China, another permanent member of the unsc, called Mr Putin a “dear friend” despite his indictment for war crimes, it confirmed that for some world powers, might makes right. This emboldens smaller bullies. In Sudan, for example, hardly anyone has been held to account for mass slaughter during the country’s various wars, nor for mass rape, nor the widespread enslavement of black Africans by the country’s Arabic-speaking elite. General Burhan and Hemedti pretended to listen to popular demands for justice after the overthrow of a former dictator, Omar al-Bashir, who has since been convicted of corruption. But it seems unlikely that they ever planned to hand over the reins to civilians, as they were supposed to do last week.Impunity is not the whole story, however. Other factors are causing conflicts to burn for longer. Climate change is fuelling fights over water and land. Religious extremism is spreading. Organised criminals are making the world’s most unstable states even more so. And conflicts are growing more complex. Between 2001 and 2010 around five countries each year suffered more than one simultaneous war or insurgency. Now 15 do (see chart 2). Sudan has conflicts in the east, west and south. Complex wars are in general harder to end. It is not enough to find a compromise that satisfies two parties; a deal may need to please dozens of groups, any one of which may cock its Kalashnikovs again if unsatisfied. Civil wars are also becoming more international. In 1991 only 4% of them involved significant foreign forces. By 2021 that had risen 12-fold to 48%, reckons the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme, a research project. In the past decade this process has been driven partly by America’s retreat from its role as global policeman, and mid-sized powers filling the vacuum. Russia and Turkey spar over Libya and Syria; Saudi Arabia and Iran have fought a proxy war in Yemen. In Sudan, Egypt supports General Burhan while Hemedti is pals with Russia.Foreign meddling can be benign, as un peacekeeping operations generally are, even if they often blunder. But interventions by external powers with selfish agendas tend to make civil wars last longer and cost more lives, finds David Cunningham of the University of Maryland. The costs for external actors are lower—their own cities are not being destroyed—so they have less incentive to make peace. Climate change is aggravating the mayhem. It does not directly cause conflict, but when pastures dry up, herders drive their hungry cattle farther afield, often encroaching on land claimed by rival ethnic groups. A review of 55 studies by Marshall Burke of Stanford University and others found that a one-standard-deviation increase in local temperature raises the chance of intergroup conflict by 11% compared with what it would have been at a more normal temperature. Globally, some 24m people were displaced by extreme weather in 2021, and the un expects that figure to soar. In Sudan, some 3m people were displaced by conflict and natural disasters even before the current round of fighting began. The bloodiest war in the world last year was not in Ukraine but in Ethiopia, notes Comfort Ero, the head of Crisis Group, a think-tank. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria who helped broker a peace deal in November between the government and the Tigray region, has put deaths at 600,000 between 2020 and 2022. No estimate for Ukraine is as high. Mohammed Kamal, an Ethiopian farmer, was ploughing his fields when he heard shooting. Returning to his village, he found that gunmen had murdered 400 people, mostly women and children. “Only a small number survived,” he says. Even if the peace deal holds, which is uncertain, it will not help Mohammed. For the massacre he witnessed was part of an entirely separate conflict, which is still blazing. While government troops were distracted by the war in Tigray, members of Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, revived an old insurgency, and are trying to drive other ethnic groups out of their home region. Mohammed says the gunmen who killed his neighbours were from the Oromo Liberation Army (ola), a rebel group; their victims were from the Amhara ethnic group. (The ola denies involvement.)If that sounds complicated, it is actually much more so. Ethiopia has more than 90 ethnic groups, many of whose leaders are tempted to stir up hatred to win control of one of the country’s 11 ethnically based regions. It hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from four turbulent neighbours (Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan). The dictatorship next door (Eritrea) has sent armies to fight against a previous Ethiopian government, and arm-in-arm with the current one. War creates a vicious circle. As droughts and floods have devastated rural areas, young men with no prospects feel more tempted to pick up a gun and grab land or loot. Rebel recruiters understand this only too well. Facebook accounts linked to OLA show videos of young fighters celebrating with stacks of cash they have liberated from banks. With so many fighters lurking in the bush, kidnapping shopkeepers and murdering officials, businesses flee the area and public services get even worse. Locals then grow even more frustrated and angry, especially when the state responds with repression, which it often does. To countries destabilised by bad governments and climate change, extremism adds gelignite. Consider the Sahel, a vast arid area below the Sahara desert. Five countries—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and (northern) Nigeria—suffered droughts in 2022 and the most severe food crisis in 20 years. Nearly 6m people were also hit by floods. Some 24m in these five countries are “food insecure” (meaning they struggle to feed themselves). In just one sub-region of Mali, the irc found no fewer than 70 conflicts in late 2021. Half were about land; a third were about water. A seventh resulted in lots of people being driven from their homes. Into this desperate environment have stepped jihadist groups. Since the Arab spring affiliates of al-Qaeda and (later) Islamic State have spread across the Middle East, Africa and beyond. They promise justice—such as the restoration of stolen grazing land—in countries where formal courts barely function. Once they have gained a foothold, they accelerate the collapse of state authority. Between 2020 and 2022 in the five countries mentioned above, the number of schools that were closed due to violence trebled, to 9,000. Half the region’s children do not feel safe in school.In Burkina Faso rival jihadist groups have made much of the country ungovernable. Towns are besieged. The government’s efforts to vanquish the jihadists often make matters worse. Trucks carrying goods to jihadist-controlled areas must have a military escort, which may or may not be available. Jihadists block roads and plant bombs on bridges. All this gums up trade and makes remote areas even poorer. The government’s inability to beat the jihadists infuriates nearly everyone: the country suffered two coups in 2022. A similar dynamic afflicts the whole of the Sahel. Instability is infectious. Farmers displaced by climate change cross unmarked borders and spark clashes. Jihadists seek havens in neighbouring countries. Their ideas spread rapidly online and in radical madrassas. Western powers have tried to help, but failed. In November 2022 France gave up on Operation Barkhane, a military intervention to help the governments of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger suppress jihadists. Earlier that year Mali’s new military regime ordered French troops out and welcomed help from Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, which has already been accused of massacring civilians. Sebastian von Einsiedel of the United Nations University in Tokyo argues that the spread of jihadist groups makes it harder to end wars. Their demands are often impossible to meet, their footsoldiers are fanatical, and external mediators hate dealing with terrorists.For rebel groups with no religious inspiration, mammon provides motive enough to take up arms. A study by James Fearon of Stanford University finds that civil wars in which a major rebel force earns money from illicit drugs or minerals tend to last longer. And the globalisation of crime has made it “easier than ever before” for such groups to get their hands on guns and cash, notes Mr von Einsiedel. Government forces are often greedy, too. Among the reasons why Congo’s war is “self-perpetuating”, argues Jason Stearns in his book “The War That Doesn’t Say Its Name”, is that officers are paid a pittance but can make fortunes from embezzlement and extortion when deployed to combat zones. Locals complain about the “pompier-pyromane” (firefighter-pyromaniac) problem: regional strongmen who start a fire so the central government has to negotiate with them to put it out.An extreme example of the links between crime and conflict is Haiti. In 2021 its president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated. No one knows who ordered the hit, but many suspect a link to the drug trade. The country has been in chaos since. Gangs that once dominated only slums now control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They have seized roads, market places and anywhere convenient for extorting money from terrified civilians. Joe, a school director who prefers to stay anonymous, describes how his school received a bullet in an envelope, with a demand for $50,000 protection money to keep classes open. “On the spot, we had to close the school until further notice,” he sighs. Haiti’s prime minister, Ariel Henry, is begging for a foreign military intervention to help the police restore order. Many locals would welcome it. Ralph Senecal, the boss of a private ambulance firm, who was kidnapped in October, says that only American troops can restore order. However, opposition groups fear that such an intervention would only prop up Mr Henry, who seized power after Moïse’s death and is widely regarded as illegitimate. One country in Asia illustrates all the ills that make civil wars endure. In an old wooden farm house near the Thai-Myanmar border, Ko Khaht is boiling chicken and rice. When it is cooked, he liquidises it, sucks it up with a syringe and feeds it to his injured comrade, who is missing part of his skull and cannot move or speak. Myanmar is home to some of the world’s oldest insurgencies, and some of the newest. Ko Khaht belongs to the People’s Defence Force (pdf), which was set up after a military junta seized power in 2021. It is the armed wing of the National Unity Government, a parallel state of activists, politicians and ethnic leaders that aims to restore democracy. He joined it after he saw soldiers murder a man in front of his home. He packed a small bag and fled to the Thai border, where he worked in a bomb-disposal unit. He has lost his right hand, and his skin is pockmarked by shrapnel.Myanmar’s strife is staggeringly complex. Perhaps 200 armed groups control slices of territory or are fighting to overthrow the government. Some are armies seeking autonomy for large ethnic groups; others are local militias trying to defend a single village. The country has not had a conflict-free year since independence in 1948. Even compared with this violent past, though, norms have atrophied in the past two years. “There’s a new level of brutality, with the tone set at the top,” says Richard Horsey of Crisis Group. In March a company calling itself the “Ogre column” was dropped into Sagaing, central Myanmar. They went on a killing, raping and torturing spree. But rebels say such atrocities only serve to strengthen their resolve. Climate change is at work: the insurgency has gained strength in the central dry zone, which has been made poorer by drought. Crime, too, gives many fighters a reason to keep fighting. The army is deeply enmeshed in heroin and jade smuggling, as are some ethnic militias. Mr Horsey expects the war “to grind on for a generation to come”.The world is not short of ideas for how to end wars. Find a respected mediator. Start unofficial talks long before the belligerents are prepared to meet publicly. Include more women and civil-society groups in the peace process. Accept that any peace deal is likely to be ugly. “Excluding people you don’t like from politics doesn’t work,” notes David Miliband, the head of the irc. Purging the Iraqi army of all supporters of Saddam Hussein’s regime was a mistake, as was trying to build a system in Afghanistan without the Taliban. But the most important measures (build functional states in war-torn countries, curb climate change) could take decades to implement.And global efforts to promote peace are hobbled by the fact that two veto-wielding members of the unsc are serial human-rights abusers that object to interference in the internal affairs of blood-spattered regimes. Russia has used its unsc veto 23 times in the past decade, scotching resolutions to allow more aid into Syria, investigate war crimes in the Balkans and (of course) to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty. China has issued nine. America has issued three, mostly to protect Israel; France and Britain, none at all. In 2001-10, when Mr Putin’s imperial ambitions were more limited and Xi Jinping was not yet in power, Russia issued only four vetoes; China, two. A French proposal to suspend the veto when mass atrocities are occurring passed the un’s general assembly last year, but has no way past Mr Putin’s veto pen. The world is entering what Mr Miliband calls “an age of impunity”.■Correction: an earlier version of this article mis-stated the affiliation of Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel.

95,Europe’s hard-hit east is pushing the toughest response in Ukraine,,07/05/22,"WHEN RUSSIA invaded Ukraine, many eastern European countries responded with hawkish resolve, fearing they could be next. Their governments pushed for the EU to cripple Russia’s economy and dug deep into their own pockets (some deeper than western counterparts) to send Ukraine weapons and aid. Countries in the EU’s east have taken in most of the 5.6m refugees who have fled the war. But doing the right thing does not come cheap, and the economic fallout of being frontline states is starting to show.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Trade was the first victim. Russia has been a big export market for some economies in the region. Trade with Russia accounted for 6% of GDP in Latvia and Lithuania in 2021 and 1.5% in Poland and Slovakia. In 2021 Russia received roughly a tenth of non- EU exports from Poland and the Baltic states. Most such links are probably severed for good, but they see that as a price worth paying. “It is Poland’s key political interest that the West does not return to doing business with Russia,” said Piotr Arak, head of the Polish Economic Institute, a government think-tank in Warsaw.Direct trade is only part of the story. Eastern EU states have become integrated into western supply chains. Their economies, especially those of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, are heavily oriented towards exports to Germany. So a hit to German industry, such as a cut-off of Russian gas, would badly hurt its suppliers in the east.Energy imports are especially thorny. Slovakia and Hungary, which got 96% and 58% of their oil from Russia last year, say any EU oil embargo should be phased in gradually. Other countries are better prepared. The Baltic states ended Russian gas imports in April and now rely on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported via ships. Poland has embargoed Russian coal and, like most countries, rejected Russia’s demand to pay for gas in roubles. In response Gazprom, which supplies 40% of the country’s gas, halted deliveries to Poland (and Bulgaria) last week. But Poland, too, has an alternative gas-import plan through its own LNG terminal and new pipelines to the gas grids of Norway and Lithuania.Shunning Russian energy means higher prices. That will be especially painful in Europe’s poorer east. Inflation was already higher in eastern Europe before the war; in April it reached double digits in many countries. In some, consumer energy bills are fixed by regulation, delaying the pain. In Slovakia, for instance, prices will only be updated in January. But “the prospect of a 100% increase in household gas prices has not sunk in yet,” says Michal Horvath, the central bank’s chief economist.In Poland inflation hit 12.3% in April, a headache for the ruling party, which faces elections next year. Government largesse is partly at fault for cost-of-living increases, and Mr Arak thinks voters will blame it: “In communist times the government would introduce higher prices, often sparking mass protests. For the majority of Poles it remains clear that the state is responsible for maintaining price levels.” To soften the blow, the government has cut value-added tax on food, gas, fuel and fertiliser. It dubs an upcoming economic package an “anti-Putin shield”.Central banks will have to act, too, notably by raising interest rates. But that will have unpleasant consequences. In Poland, where about 90% of loans to households and businesses have variable rates, mortgage-holders are heavily exposed. Banks have already tightened credit standards considerably. Along with inflation, rocketing house prices and sagging business confidence, that could spell a “perfect storm”, says Adam Czerniak, head of research at Polityka Insight, a think-tank in Warsaw. Higher interest rates and weakening economies mean that rising government debt will become more expensive to service, especially in countries such as Hungary where debt is already high.Spending on refugees will further spur inflation. Take housing. In Warsaw rents have jumped by more than 30% since the end of February. Strains on public services are similar. Refugees have swelled Poland’s population by almost 8% since the war in Ukraine started in late February. That puts pressure on health care and education, which were already in poor shape. This will be partially offset, however, by the newcomers joining the local labour forces. In Slovakia and Hungary, the dedication of NGOs and private citizens has compensated for a lack of public services for refugees.The war’s economic costs to eastern Europe look formidable. But that seems not to have softened countries’ resolve. The economic hit is seen as manageable. Poland’s economy, which remains strong, had not seen a recession in almost three decades until the covid-19 pandemic, notes Wojciech Kopczuk of Columbia University. The Baltic countries suffered much worse during the financial crisis, adds Morten Hansen of the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga. Citizens absorbed that suffering because it was needed to join the euro, part of the countries’ strategic drive to integrate into the West. As in the current crisis, they were willing to undergo economic pain to safeguard their independence.The war and its aftermath will have some economic benefits for eastern Europe. Bulgaria aims to become a regional energy hub. Poland in particular stands to gain from Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction and its increasing integration into the EU. “No Western country has as close intergovernmental ties with Ukraine as Poland,” says Oktawian Zajac of the Warsaw office of the Boston Consulting Group. The ties that Ukrainian migrants and refugees are forming will also bring economic benefits down the line, argues Mr Kopczuk.The responses of central and eastern European states to the Ukraine crisis “will define the region for decades to come,” says Sona Muzikarova of Globsec, a think-tank in Bratislava. Undeterred by the economic pain of the war, they are showing by example that Russian aggression must be firmly resisted. ■Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisThis article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline ""Bearing the brunt""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents The West and Ukraine need to set priorities and organise betterChanging from a country of emigrants to one of immigrantsHave the limits of the EU’s support for its neighbour been reached?"
96,How Putin’s war is causing global instability,,18/11/22,"By Robert Guest: Foreign editor, The EconomistWHEN TWO elephants fight, the grass suffers, goes the proverb. But what happens when a big bear attacks a smaller creature and comes off worse? Traditional sayings offer little guidance. Nonetheless, this is a crucial question for medium-sized powers in 2023. The bloody nose Ukraine is giving Vladimir Putin changes many geopolitical calculations. Your browser does not support the <audio> element.If Mr Putin loses, some countries that fear Russia, such as the Baltic states, will fear it less. Others will worry that a defeated Russia might be even less predictable. Mr Putin has not directly threatened Kazakhstan, which like Ukraine has a long border with Russia and a large Russian-speaking minority. But nationalist Russian pundits urge him to dismember it, seizing land to “protect” ethnic Russians from imaginary persecution. Their lies about Kazakhstan bear a scary similarity to the ones they tell about Ukraine: that it has biowarfare labs near the Russian border, for example, and that it is planning to ban Russian-language teaching in schools. However the war in Ukraine ends, Kazakhs will have reason to be nervous. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggests that no country that has ever been ruled from Moscow is safe. Those that can forge closer ties with NATO will do so: Georgia and Moldova are keen. Those that cannot realistically expect help from NATO, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, will seek deeper ties with China. If there are Chinese railways and factories on their territory, they assume, Russia will be less likely to attack them. The only regimes likely to draw closer to Russia in 2023 will be its fellow pariahs, particularly Iran, which needs a friendly trading partner and a buddy on the un Security Council. Regimes that depend on Russian support will grow more nervous. Belarus’s despotic ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, has clung to power largely thanks to Mr Putin’s backing. In return, he allowed Belarusian territory to be used as a launchpad for the Russian attack on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, which failed dismally. Mr Lukashenko is eager not to be sucked more deeply into the war, which is hugely unpopular with Belarusians and intensifies the scorn they feel for their election-rigging president. But Mr Putin will keep pressing him.In Africa, Wagner, a mercenary outfit run by a Putin crony, props up autocratic governments in the Central African Republic and Mali and backs a warlord in Libya. These operations are probably self-financing through murky minerals deals. But some of Wagner’s thugs have been called to fight in Ukraine. If its African operations ever lose the tacit support of the Russian state, they will struggle to keep their clients in power. Energy producers will see their diplomatic clout enhanced for as long as the war disrupts energy markets. Cash-flush Saudi Arabia will feel little real pressure to improve its human-rights record or diversify its economy. Suppliers of alternatives to Russian gas will thrive. Europe is showering money on Qatar, a big exporter of liquefied natural gas. Egypt, which once quarrelled with Qatar over its support for Islamists, is now cosying up to it in the hope of financial support. Political ripples from high food and energy prices will continuePolitical ripples from high food and energy prices will continue. They have already contributed to protests and riots in many countries, and to the overthrow of Sri Lanka’s president. Even if food prices moderate somewhat in 2023, expect unrest in places such as Pakistan and Tunisia, where people blame unpopular governments for empty plates. Trouble is even likelier in countries where poor economic policies have aggravated the damage and fraught elections are scheduled for 2023, such as Nigeria and Turkey. The latter is an unusual case. Diplomatically, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hopes to take advantage of the war in Ukraine no matter how it unfolds. If Mr Putin loses and Russia is seriously weakened, a power vacuum may open in places Turkey cares about, such as Syria and the south Caucasus. If Russian backing for Armenia wobbles, Mr Erdogan will intensify his support for Azerbaijan, which has been fighting Armenia over territory. If the Ukraine war drags on, Mr Erdogan will continue to play both sides. He will expect rewards from Moscow, such as cheap gas, for welcoming Russian money and tourists. He will also sell more weapons to Ukraine, and demand credit from the West for denying Russian warships entry to the Black Sea. And if Mr Erdogan loses an election in June, his successor will probably take a similar approach to foreign policy. Overall, Mr Putin’s humiliation in Ukraine will make autocrats everywhere wary of starting wars of conquest—and doubly so if defeat leads to his downfall. All the more important, then, for Ukraine’s backers to redouble their support. Aggression must not pay, and must be seen not to pay. The world will be more peaceful in the long run if Mr Putin loses.■Robert Guest: Foreign editor, The EconomistThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “How Putin’s war is causing global instability”A global round-up from The Economist Intelligence UnitAs 2023 begins, the world’s most important climate system remains locked in La NiñaOur selection of events around the world"
97,War by any other name,,03/07/14,"A “NON-LINEAR” war, explains Natan Dubovitsky, a writer, is how states are likely to fight each other in future—if they do not already. Individual regions or cities will form temporary coalitions, only to split apart in mid-fighting and find new allies. Each force has its own aims, and these too can be fluid. The war has many components, of which battle is only one element. “Most understood the war to be part of a process,” writes Mr Dubovitsky, and “not necessarily its most important part.”Mr Dubovitsky’s idea was featured in a short story published in March, as Russian forces were seizing control of Crimea. Its most telling detail is the author’s real identity: Vladislav Surkov, a long-standing ideological adviser to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr Surkov’s tale is a fanciful exercise, but it is also as good a blueprint as any for the Kremlin’s efforts to direct the war in eastern Ukraine.After a ten-day ceasefire that was widely ignored, fierce fighting resumed in eastern Ukraine on July 1st. Both sides have suffered heavy losses. Pro-Kiev forces have resumed shelling with heavy artillery, including of civilian areas. The Ukrainian army claims to have recaptured a border post with Russia—a necessary step if it is to encircle and gradually wear down the pro-Russian rebels.In recent days Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, has come under intense pressure not to extend the temporary ceasefire that Mr Putin persistently and disingenuously calls for. A growing nationalist lobby in Kiev is pushing to continue the fight instead. With anti-government militias observing the ceasefire either fitfully or not at all, Mr Poroshenko may have reasoned that only the rebels were benefiting from breaks in the conflict.For his part, Mr Putin appears, at least for now, to have ruled out a full-frontal invasion. On June 24th he theatrically instructed the ever-loyal upper house of parliament to cancel the authorisation for military force in Ukraine that he had ordered up in early March. The move was largely an empty fob to Mr Poroshenko and another way to ward off more Western sanctions. Yet even if a tanks-and-soldiers invasion seems unlikely, a Russian invasion of another sort began long ago: one that resembles the slippery, post-modern war described by Mr Surkov.The nature of the incursion speaks volumes for the reach of the Russian state under Mr Putin. Today’s Russia thinks of itself as a mobilisation state, ready to deploy a full array of instruments in a crisis. In Ukraine this means a policy that combines covert arms transfers, volunteer fighters called up by patriotic organisations, oligarchs and others, propaganda produced by state-run media, punitive arm-twisting over gas prices and a worsening of political repression at home. Officials in Moscow, who have taken to praising non-linear war even if they do not use the precise term, say they are wielding the same tools the Americans use all the time: first engineer protests, and if that doesn’t work, back them up by force.The advantage of such an approach is “plausible deniability,” explains Dmitry Gorenburg of CNA Corporation, a policy and security think-tank. Above all, it helps Russia to avoid a new round of American and European sanctions, which would aim not just at individuals but at entire industries. Existing sanctions and the fears of more to come have already had a “chilling effect” on investment, according to the IMF, which now says that Russian GDP growth will be zero this year. The murkiness and obfuscation of Mr Putin’s non-linear war in Ukraine also complicate Western diplomacy, dividing opinion and making it harder to find consensus.What Mr Putin would really like is a conflict of just the right size: big enough to force Mr Poroshenko into concessions but not so large it drags Russia in directly or forces it to subsidise Ukraine’s eastern regions. As Mr Gorenburg explains, Mr Putin will facilitate the transfer of Russian arms, fighters and money so as to ensure that “the insurgency isn’t defeated, but while doing the minimum possible”.Mr Putin’s apparent interest in an on-again, off-again cycle of ceasefires and negotiations suggests that he would like to lock the conflict in place, legitimising the so-called people’s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk and raising the profile of these rebel commanders ready to take orders from Moscow. Such a war—oscillating between open fighting and political talks, but without ever being completely resolved—would resemble other frozen conflicts around the former Soviet Union. In Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdniestria, unsettled but largely bloodless conflicts serve to constrain the Georgian and Moldovan governments as well as providing a built-in lever for Russian meddling.Mr Putin may welcome something similar in eastern Ukraine. But those earlier conflicts differ in one important aspect: they are based on genuine, deeply felt ethnic and religious cleavages. Although plenty of Russian-speakers in Donetsk and Luhansk resent Kiev and would like more autonomy, such Balkan-like divisions do not really exist in Ukraine.A more likely outcome is warlordism, or the rise of authorities who rely for their position not on ideology but on “force and patronage,” explains Kimberly Marten at Columbia university. Warlords, Ms Marten says, use violence and bribery to exert control over territory and money flows—the sort of informal politics that Moscow knows well. In conflict zones like eastern Ukraine, those who enjoy access to resources naturally see their influence rise. The Kremlin’s preferred intermediaries—men like Alexander Borodai, a Russian public-relations manager and political consultant who is now prime minister of Donetsk’s “people’s republic”—have become ever more prominent.The question for Mr Putin is how far he is willing to go if Ukrainian forces seem to be gaining the upper hand over the rebels. In a pure military contest Kiev is likely to prevail, given enough time. “Even just standing still will require Russia to put in more resources,” says Mark Galeotti of New York University. Mr Putin may not be able to avoid this. Igor Korotchenko, a military analyst and editor who is close to the defence ministry, argues that Russia should step up its support to anti-Kiev forces following the precedent of America’s support to Syria’s rebels.The question for the West is how much of an appetite it has for tougher measures.

98,From cold war to hot war,,12/02/15,"THE pens were on the table in Minsk, Belarus’s capital, for the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to sign a deal to end a year-long war fuelled by Russia and fought by its proxies. But on February 12th, after all-night talks, they were put away. “No good news,” said Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president. Instead there will be a ceasefire from February 15th. A tentative agreement has been reached to withdraw heavy weaponry.But Russia looks sure to be able to keep open its border with Ukraine and sustain the flow of arms and people. The siege of Debaltseve, a strategic transport hub held by Ukrainian forces, continues. Russia is holding military exercises on its side of the border. Crimea was not even mentioned.Meanwhile the IMF has said it will lend Ukraine $17.5 billion to prop up its economy. But Mr Putin seems to be relying on a familiar Russian tactic of exhausting his negotiating counterparts and taking two steps forward, one step back. He is counting on time and endurance to bring the collapse and division of Ukraine and a revision of the post-cold war world order.Nearly a quarter-century after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West faces a greater threat from the East than at any point during the cold war. Even during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, Soviet leaders were constrained by the Politburo and memories of the second world war. Now, according to Russia’s chief propagandist, Dmitry Kiselev, even a decision about the use of nuclear arms “will be taken personally by Mr Putin, who has the undoubted support of the Russian people”. Bluff or not, this reflects the Russian elite’s perception of the West as a threat to the very existence of the Russian state.In this view Russia did not start the war in Ukraine, but responded to Western aggression. The Maidan uprising and ousting of Viktor Yanukovych as Ukraine’s president were engineered by American special services to move NATO closer to Russia’s borders. Once Mr Yanukovych had gone, American envoys offered Ukraine’s interim government $25 billion to place missile defences on the Russian border, in order to shift the balance of nuclear power towards America. Russia had no choice but to act.Even without Ukraine, Mr Putin has said, America would have found some other excuse to contain Russia. Ukraine, therefore, was not the cause of Russia’s conflict with the West, but its consequence. Mr Putin’s purpose is not to rebuild the Soviet empire—he knows this is impossible—but to protect Russia’s sovereignty. By this he means its values, the most important of which is a monopoly on state power.Behind Russia’s confrontation with the West lies a clash of ideas. On one side are human rights, an accountable bureaucracy and democratic elections; on the other an unconstrained state that can sacrifice its citizens’ interests to further its destiny or satisfy its rulers’ greed. Both under communism and before it, the Russian state acquired religious attributes. It is this sacred state which is under threat.Mr Putin sits at its apex. “No Putin—no Russia,” a deputy chief of staff said recently. His former KGB colleagues—the Committee of State Security—are its guardians, servants and priests, and entitled to its riches. Theirs is not a job, but an elite and hereditary calling. Expropriating a private firm’s assets to benefit a state firm is therefore not an act of corruption.When thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets demanding a Western-European way of life, the Kremlin saw this as a threat to its model of governance. Alexander Prokhanov, a nationalist writer who backs Russia’s war in Ukraine, compares European civilisation to a magnet attracting Ukraine and Russia. Destabilising Ukraine is not enough to counter that force: the magnet itself must be neutralised.Russia feels threatened not by any individual European state, but by the European Union and NATO, which it regards as expansionist. It sees them as “occupied” by America, which seeks to exploit Western values to gain influence over the rest of the world. America “wants to freeze the order established after the Soviet collapse and remain an absolute leader, thinking it can do whatever it likes, while others can do only what is in that leader’s interests,” Mr Putin said recently. “Maybe some want to live in a semi-occupied state, but we do not.”Russia has taken to arguing that it is not fighting Ukraine, but America in Ukraine. The Ukrainian army is just a foreign legion of NATO, and American soldiers are killing Russian proxies in the Donbas. Anti-Americanism is not only the reason for war and the main pillar of state power, but also an ideology that Russia is trying to export to Europe, as it once exported communism.Anti-Westernism has been dressed not in communist clothes, but in imperial and even clerical ones (see article). “We see how many Euro-Atlantic countries are in effect turning away from their roots, including their Christian values,” said Mr Putin in 2013. Russia, by contrast, “has always been a state civilisation held together by the Russian people, the Russian language, Russian culture and the Russian Orthodox church.” The Donbas rebels are fighting not only the Ukrainian army, but against a corrupt Western way of life in order to defend Russia’s distinct world view.Many in the West equate the end of communism with the end of the cold war. In fact, by the time the Soviet Union fell apart, Marxism-Leninism was long dead. Stalin replaced the ideals of internationalism, equality and social justice that the Bolsheviks had proclaimed in 1917 with imperialism and state dominance over all spheres of life. Mikhail Gorbachev’s revolution consisted not in damping down Marxism but in proclaiming the supremacy of universal human values over the state, opening up Russia to the West.Nationalists, Stalinists, communists and monarchists united against Mr Gorbachev. Anti-Americanism had brought Stalinists and nationalists within the Communist Party closer together. When communism collapsed they united against Boris Yeltsin and his attempts to make Russia “normal”, by which he meant a Western-style free-market democracy.By 1993, when members of this coalition were ejected by pro-Yeltsin forces from the parliament building they had occupied in Moscow, they seemed defeated. Yet nationalism has resurfaced. Those who fought Yeltsin and his ideas were active in the annexation of Crimea and are involved in the war in south-east Ukraine. Alexander Borodai, the first “prime minister” of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, who fought with anti-Yeltsin forces, hails Mr Putin as the leader of the nationalist movement in Russia today.Yet for a few years after Mr Putin came to power he built close relations with NATO. In his first two presidential terms, rising living standards helped buy acceptance of his monopoly on state power and reliance on ex-KGB men; now that the economy is shrinking, the threat of war is needed to legitimise his rule. He forged his alliance with Orthodox nationalists only during mass street protests by Westernised liberals in 2012, when he returned to the Kremlin. Instead of tear gas, he has used nationalist, imperialist ideas, culminating in the annexation of Crimea and the slow subjugation of south-east Ukraine.Mr Putin’s preferred method is “hybrid warfare”: a blend of hard and soft power. A combination of instruments, some military and some non-military, choreographed to surprise, confuse and wear down an opponent, hybrid warfare is ambiguous in both source and intent, making it hard for multinational bodies such as NATO and the EU to craft a response. But without the ability to apply hard power, Russia’s version of soft power would achieve little. Russia “has invested heavily in defence,” says NATO’s new secretary-general, a former Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg. “It has shown it can deploy forces at very short notice…above all, it has shown a willingness to use force.”Mr Putin drew two lessons from his brief war in Georgia in 2008. The first was that Russia could deploy hard power in countries that had been in the Soviet Union and were outside NATO with little risk of the West responding with force. The second, after a slapdash campaign, was that Russia’s armed forces needed to be reformed. Military modernisation became a personal mission to redress “humiliations” visited by an “overweening” West on Russia since the cold war ended.According to IHS Jane’s, a defence consultancy, by next year Russia’s defence spending will have tripled in nominal terms since 2007, and it will be halfway through a ten-year, 20 trillion rouble ($300 billion) programme to modernise its weapons. New types of missiles, bombers and submarines are being readied for deployment over the next few years. Spending on defence and security is expected to climb by 30% this year and swallow more than a third of the federal budget.As well as money for combat aircraft, helicopters, armoured vehicles and air-defence systems, about a third of the budget has been earmarked to overhaul Russia’s nuclear forces. A revised military doctrine signed by Mr Putin in December identified “reinforcement of NATO’s offensive capacities directly on Russia’s borders, and measures taken to deploy a global anti-missile defence system” in central Europe as the greatest threats Russia faces.In itself, that may not be cause for alarm in the West. Russian nuclear doctrine has changed little since 2010, when the bar for first use was slightly raised to situations in which “the very existence of the state is under threat”. That may reflect growing confidence in Russia’s conventional forces. But Mr Putin is fond of saying that nobody should try to shove Russia around when it has one of the world’s biggest nuclear arsenals. Mr Kiselev puts it even more bluntly: “During the years of romanticism [ie, detente], the Soviet Union undertook not to use nuclear weapons first. Modern Russian doctrine does not. The illusions are gone.”Mr Putin still appears wedded to a strategy he conceived in 2000: threatening a limited nuclear strike to force an opponent (ie, America and its NATO allies) to withdraw from a conflict in which Russia has an important stake, such as in Georgia or Ukraine. Nearly all its large-scale military exercises in the past decade have featured simulations of limited nuclear strikes, including one on Warsaw.Mr Putin has also been streamlining his armed forces, with the army recruiting 60,000 contract soldiers each year. Professionals now make up 30% of the force. Conscripts may bulk up the numbers, but for the kind of complex, limited wars Mr Putin wants to be able to win, they are pretty useless. Ordinary contract soldiers are also still a long way behind special forces such as the GRU Spetsnaz (the “little green men” who went into Crimea without military insignia) and the elite airborne VDV troops, but they are catching up.South-east Ukraine shows the new model army at work. Spetsnaz units first trained the Kremlin-backed separatist rebels in tactics and the handling of sophisticated Russian weapons. But when the Ukrainian government began to make headway in early summer, Russia had regular forces near the border to provide a calibrated (and still relatively covert) response.It is hard to tell how many Russian troops have seen action in Ukraine, as their vehicles and uniforms carry no identifiers. But around 4,000 were sent to relieve Luhansk and Donetsk while threatening the coastal city of Mariupol—enough to convince Mr Poroshenko to draw his troops back. Since November a new build-up of Russian forces has been under way. Ukrainian military intelligence reckons there may be 9,000 in their country (NATO has given no estimate). Another 50,000 are on the Russian side of the border.Despite Mr Putin’s claim last year that he could “take Kiev in two weeks” if he wanted, a full-scale invasion and subsequent occupation is beyond Russia. But a Russian-controlled mini-state, Novorossiya, similar to Abkhazia and Transdniestria, could be more or less economically sustainable. And it would end Ukraine’s hopes of ever regaining sovereignty over its territory other than on Russian terms, which would undoubtedly include staying out of the EU and NATO. Not a bad outcome for Mr Putin, and within reach with the hard power he controls.The big fear for NATO is that Mr Putin turns his hybrid warfare against a member country. Particularly at risk are the Baltic states—Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania—two of which have large Russian-speaking minorities. In January Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO’s previous secretary-general, said there was a “high probability” that Mr Putin would test NATO’s Article 5, which regards an attack on any member as an attack on all—though “he will be defeated” if he does so.A pattern of provocation has been established that includes a big increase in the number of close encounters involving Russian aircraft and naval vessels, and snap exercises by Russian forces close to NATO’s northern and eastern borders. Last year NATO planes carried out more than 400 intercepts of Russian aircraft. More than 150 were by the alliance’s beefed-up Baltic air-policing mission—four times as many as in 2013. In the first nine months of the year, 68 “hot” identifications and interdictions occurred along the Lithuanian border alone. Latvia recorded more than 150 incidents of Russian planes entering its airspace.There have also been at least two near-misses between Russian military aircraft and Swedish airliners. This is dangerous stuff: Russian pilots do not file flight plans. They fly with transponders switched off, which makes them invisible to civil radar. On January 28th two Russian, possibly nuclear-armed, strategic bombers flew down the English Channel, causing havoc to commercial aviation. Such behaviour is intended to test Western air defences, and was last seen in the cold war. Mr Stoltenberg calls it “risky and unjustified”.Since 2013, when Russia restarted large-scale snap military exercises, at least eight have been held. In December the Kremlin ordered one in Kaliningrad, an exclave that borders Lithuania and Poland, both NATO members. It mobilised 9,000 soldiers, more than 55 navy ships and every type of military aircraft. “This pattern of behaviour can be used to hide intent,” says General Philip Breedlove, NATO’s most senior commander. “What is it masking? What is it conditioning us for?”A huge problem for NATO is that most of what Russia might attempt will be below the radar of traditional collective defence. According to Mr Stoltenberg, deciding whether an Article 5 attack has taken place means both recognising what is going on and knowing who is behind it. “We need more intelligence and better situational awareness,” he says; but adds that NATO allies accept that if the arrival of little green men can be attributed “to an aggressor nation, it is an Article 5 action and then all the assets of NATO come to bear.”For all the rhetoric of the cold war, the Soviet Union and America had been allies and winners in the second world war and felt a certain respect for each other. The Politburo suffered from no feelings of inferiority. In contrast, Mr Putin and his KGB men came out of the cold war as losers. What troubles Mr Stoltenberg greatly about Mr Putin’s new, angry Russia is that it is harder to deal with than the old Soviet Union. As a Norwegian, used to sharing an Arctic border with Russia, he says that “even during the coldest period of the cold war we were able to have a pragmatic conversation with them on many security issues”. Russia had “an interest in stability” then, “but not now”.Destabilisation is also being achieved in less military ways. Wielding power or gaining influence abroad—through antiestablishment political parties, disgruntled minority groups, media outlets, environmental activists, supporters in business, propagandist “think-tanks”, and others—has become part of the Kremlin’s hybrid-war strategy. This perversion of “soft power” is seen by Moscow as a vital complement to military engagement.Certainly Russia is not alone in abusing soft power. The American government’s aid agency, USAID, has planted tweets in Cuba and the Middle East to foster dissent. And Mr Putin has hinted that Russia needs to fight this way because America and others are already doing so, through “pseudo-NGOs”, CNN and human-rights groups.At home Russian media, which are mostly state-controlled, churn out lies and conspiracy theories. Abroad, the main conduit for the Kremlin’s world view is RT, a TV channel set up in 2005 to promote a positive view of Russia that now focuses on making the West look bad. It uses Western voices: far-left anti-globalists, far-right nationalists and disillusioned individuals. It broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and is planning German- and French-language channels. It claims to reach 700m people worldwide and 2.7m hotel rooms. Though it is not a complete farce, it has broadcast a string of false stories, such as one speculating that America was behind the Ebola epidemic in west Africa.The Kremlin is also a sophisticated user of the internet and social media. It employs hundreds of “trolls” to garrison the comment sections and Twitter feeds of the West. The point is not so much to promote the Kremlin’s views, but to denigrate opposition figures, and foreign governments and institutions, and to sow fear and confusion. Vast sums have been thrown at public-relations and lobbying firms to improve Russia’s image abroad—among them Ketchum, based in New York, which helped place an op-ed by Mr Putin in the New York Times. And it can rely on some of its corporate partners to lobby against policies that would hurt Russian business.The West’s willingness to shelter Russian money, some of it gained corruptly, demoralises the Russian opposition while making the West more dependent on the Kremlin. Russian money has had a poisonous effect closer to home, too. Russia wields soft power in the Baltics partly through its “compatriots policy”, which entails financial support for Russian-speaking minorities abroad.Mr Putin’s most devious strategy, however, is to destabilise the EU through fringe political parties (see article). Russia’s approach to ideology is fluid: it supports both far-left and far-right groups. As Peter Pomerantsev and Michael Weiss put it in “The menace of unreality”, a paper on Russian soft power: “The aim is to exacerbate divides [in the West] and create an echo-chamber of Kremlin support.”Far-right groups are seduced by the idea of Moscow as a counterweight to the EU, and by its law-and-order policies. Its stance on homosexuality and promotion of “traditional” moral values appeal to religious conservatives. The far left likes the talk of fighting American hegemony. Russia’s most surprising allies, however, are probably Europe’s Greens. They are opposed to shale-gas fracking and nuclear power—as is Moscow, because both promise to lessen Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Mr Rasmussen has accused Russia of “sophisticated” manipulation of information to hobble fracking in Europe, though without producing concrete evidence.There is circumstantial evidence in Bulgaria, which in 2012 cancelled a permit for Chevron to explore for shale gas after anti-fracking protests. Some saw Russia’s hand in these, possibly to punish the pro-European government of the time, which sought to reduce its reliance on Russian energy (Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled gas giant, supplies 90% of Bulgaria’s gas).Previously, Bulgaria had been expected to transport Russian oil through its planned South Stream pipeline, and its parliament had approved a bill that would have exempted the project from awkward EU rules. Much of it had been written by Gazprom, and the construction contract was to go to a firm owned by Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch now under Western sanctions. Gazprom offered to finance the pipeline and to sponsor a Bulgarian football team. The energy minister at the time later claimed he had been offered bribes by a Russian envoy to smooth the project’s passage. Though European opposition means it has now been scrapped, the episode shows the methods Moscow uses to protect its economic interests.In all this Mr Putin is evidently acting not only for Russia’s sake, but for his own. Mr Borodai, the rebel ideologue in Donetsk, says that if necessary the Russian volunteers who are fighting today in Donbas will tomorrow defend their president on the streets of Moscow. Yet, although Mr Putin may believe he is using nationalists, the nationalists believe they are using him to consolidate their power. What they aspire to, with or without Mr Putin, is that Russians rally behind the nationalist state and their leader to take on Western liberalism. This is not a conflict that could have been resolved in Minsk.Timeline picture credits: Reuters; Ria Novosti This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline ""From cold war to hot war""Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Its defences against Western sanctions can only stretch so farBut the country could still undercut its own successThe effectiveness and side-effects of the most common treatments are not well understood"
