      "the tight ring of security that surrounds the seat of the russian presidency was punctured in dramatic fashion by what appeared to be two attempted drone strikes in the early hours of wednesday morning. but until the kremlin chose to publicize the incident around 12 hours later, social media footage of the incident had gained little attention. why russia decided to reveal the security breach is unclear. but in a five-paragraph statement on wednesday, the kremlin made the incendiary claim that the drones were an assassination attempt launched by ukraine on the the russian president, vladimir putin. kyiv forcefully denied the claim. kyiv was bombarded with missiles in the hours following russia's claims, in keeping with putin's historic willingness to strike ukrainian cities after any alleged act of provocation. many details about the incident remain murky. here's what we know -- and the questions that remain. what happened? moscow said the alleged attack took place in the early hours of wednesday. two \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" were intercepted and destroyed before they caused any damage or injury, the kremlin said. the russian president was not in the building at the time, according to kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov. videos then emerged on social media appearing to show the incident. cnn analysis of these videos supports moscow's claim that two drones were flown above the kremlin. a video that appeared to show smoke rising from the kremlin surfaced on a telegram channel at 2:37 a.m. local time wednesday. the first reports of the incident citing the kremlin came via russian state media tass and ria around 2:33 p.m. local time -- around 12 hours later. shortly after the first media reports, another video appearing to show the moment a drone exploded above the kremlin began circulating widely on social media. in the video, the apparent drone seems to fly towards the building's domed roof, followed by what looks like a small explosion. in this video, two people appear to be climbing on the dome holding flashlights, and can be seen ducking down just before the moment of the explosion. the people climbing the dome are not present in the first of these videos, but appear in the second, suggesting they were responding to the fire caused by the first drone at the time the subsequent drone appeared. who's saying what? the kremlin blamed ukraine, describing the purported drone attack as an \"attempt on the president's life.\" in a statement, the kremlin said, \"we view these actions as a planned terrorist attack and an assassination attempt,\" adding that \"russia reserves the right to take countermeasures wherever and whenever it deems appropriate.\" on thursday, russia also claimed the us was involved in the attack. \"undoubtedly, such decisions, the definition of goals, the definition of means -- all this is dictated to kyiv from washington,\" peksov said. both allegations drew sharp denials from kyiv and washington. \"we don't attack putin or moscow,\" president volodymyr zelensky said during a news conference in helsinki on wednesday. \"we fight on our territory, we are defending our villages and cities. we don't have enough weapon[s] for this. that's why we don't use it anywhere [else],\" zelensky said. \"we didn't attack putin. we leave it to tribunal,\" he said. john kirby, the national security council's coordinator for strategic communications, called russia's allegation that the us directed ukraine to carry out such an attack \"ridiculous.\" secretary of state anthony blinken said it the us did not know who was responsible. \"i would take anything coming out of the kremlin with a very large shaker of salt,\" he told a washingon post event on wednesday. who else could be responsible? if ukraine wasn't the perpetrator, one possibility is that the incident was the work of russian partisans -- as claimed by a former russian lawmaker linked with militant groups in russia. ilya ponomarev told cnn's matthew chance that \"it's one of (the) russian partisan groups,\" adding that \"i cannot say more, as they have not yet publicly claimed responsibility.\" ponomarev, who lives in exile in ukraine and poland, was the only russian mp to vote against the annexation of crimea by russia in 2014 and has since been included on a list of terrorist suspects, according to the russian authorities. according to ponomarev, members of partisans group inside russia are usually \"youngsters, students, residents of large cities. i am aware of the partisan activity in approximately 40 cities across russia,\" he told cnn. evidence of actual partisan activity inside russia remains scant. a formation calling itself the russian volunteer corps is fighting on the side of kyiv in ukraine and claimed to have carried out a brief armed incursion into russian territory earlier this year, but the group's size is unclear. russia claims ukraine has carried out drone strikes on military airfields in western and southwestern russia, but kyiv has neither confirmed nor denied those allegations. us officials have also said they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible. whatever the truth, any admission of a security breach at the heart of the kremlin is remarkable. what happens next? moscow already launched a wave of missiles at kyiv following the incident, a move in line with its playbook after previous flashpoints in the war. and messages written on russian drones launched at odesa overnight read \"for moscow\" and \"for the kremlin,\" according to the ukrainian military, an apparent reference to the alleged attack. us and ukrainian officials have in the past warned that russia has planned so-called \"false flag\" attacks along russia's border with ukraine as a pretext for military escalation, including russian claims ahead of last year's full-scale invasion that ukraine was sending \"saboteurs\" over the russian border. russia has also been embarrassed in recent months by symbolic incidents such as the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser moskva, the flagship of its black sea fleet, under disputed circumstances. moscow is also looking to project strength by following through with its planned victory day parade. peskov reiterated that the parade would go ahead as planned. but while russia has on occasion used missile bombardments around ukraine to show its anger following flashpoints in the conflict, the ground fighting in eastern ukraine has been bogged down in stalemate for months and it appears unlikely that wednesday's incident will have a material impact on momentum.\n",

      "us ambassador to russia lynne tracy visited paul whelan on thursday her first visit to the detained american since taking up the post in moscow earlier this year. \"his release remains an absolute priority,\" the us embassy in moscow said on twitter.  whelan is serving out his prison sentence at a prison camp in mordovia, an eight-hour drive from moscow. background on whelan's case: the american citizen, who also holds irish, british and canadian citizenship, was detained in russia in december 2018 and later sentenced to 16 years in prison on an espionage charge, which he strongly denies.  in an interview with cnn in december, whelan described the prison camp as \"better than most in russia because it's mostly foreigners held here, but the conditions are extremely bad.\" although thursday was tracy's first in-person visit, she has spoken by phone with whelan in the past. the us government was unable to secure whelan's release last year when they brought home two other wrongfully detained americans: trevor reed in april and brittney griner in december. other detained americans: whelan is one of two americans still in russia who has been designated as wrongfully detained. the other, wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich, was imprisoned more than a month ago. read more here. the united states still does not have information needed to provide an assessment on this week's alleged drone attack on the kremlin, according to director of national intelligence avril haines. you've seen the ukrainian government deny their having engaged in this. and, at this stage we don't have information that would allow us to provide an independent assessment on this, haines said. in an exchange with sen. tom cotton at a senate armed services committee hearing, haines confirmed that russian president vladimir putin does not spend the night at the kremlin all that much and that ukraine denied the attack, whereas in past attacks against russia, ukraine has been ambiguous or silent about responsibility for the attacks. perhaps some grounds to think that maybe these claims are exaggerated, cotton said. defense intelligence agency director lt. gen. scott berrier said russia s claim that ukraine tried to assassinate putin with american assistance was likely misinformation. some background: cnn analysis of videos showing the incident support the kremlin s claim that two drones were flown above the government compound early wednesday, but did not show evidence it was a ukrainian attack. ukraine has flatly denied any involvement, saying it only strikes within its own territory and is not launching attacks in russia. the white house has called the kremlin's accusation that it was involved in an attempt on putin's life \"ridiculous.\" ##kremlin incident## russia will likely not be able to mount a significant offensive operation this year due to munitions and manpower shortages whether or not the ukrainian counteroffensive is successful, according to director of national intelligence avril haines. in fact, if russia does not initiate a mandatory mobilization and secure substantial third-party ammunition supplies beyond existing deliveries from iran and others, it will be increasingly challenging for them to sustain even modest offensive operations, haines testified to the senate armed services committee. putin probably has scaled back his near-term ambitions in ukraine to consider a victory to consolidate control of the occupied territory in eastern and southern ukraine, and ensuring that ukraine will never become a nato ally, haines added. despite this assessment, haines said it wasn't very likely that russia negotiates a pause this year unless political factors \"alter his thinking.\" haines also noted that russian forces are preparing new defensive positions for the ukrainian counteroffensive, and have gained less territory in april than during any of the three previous months. here's where the state of russian control in ukrainian territory stands: there is a persistent and significant risk that russia could target critical allied infrastructure, including undersea internet cables, as part of its war on ukraine, david cattler, nato s assistant secretary general for intelligence and security, said. there are heightened concerns that russia may target undersea cables and other critical infrastructure in an effort to disrupt western life and gain leverage against those nations that are providing support to ukraine, cattler told reporters on wednesday.  according to cattler, more than 95% of international internet traffic is transmitted through roughly 400 undersea cables. these cables carry an estimated 10 trillion us dollars worth of financial transactions every day, he said, adding that they are an economic linchpin. while russia is actively mapping this infrastructure, cattler said, china is another significant actor on the seabed. beijing, cattler added, is working towards developing its own undersea infrastructure rather than extensively testing the vulnerabilities of other nations . nato allies are monitoring the situation closely, cattler stated. this is really a holistic, multi-spectrum, multi-domain threat set when it comes to critical infrastructure. cooperation between the private sector and nato and allied governance is really crucial in order to have a clear threat picture,\" he said. a pentagon spokesperson denied us involvement in the purported drone attack on the kremlin and accused russian president vladimir putin s spokesperson of lying.  \"i would just tell you mr. (dmitry) peskov's lying. i mean, it's obviously a ludicrous claim. the united states had nothing to do with this. we don't even know what happened here,\" said john kirby, the national security council coordinator for strategic communications. \"but i can assure you the united states had no role in it whatsoever.\" the white house still has no indication who was behind the drone attack and said the white house does not \"endorse, we do not encourage, we do not support attacks on individual leaders,\" kirby added.  russia has accused washington of being behind what it says was a drone attack on the kremlin and an assassination attempt against putin, the latest in a series of extraordinary allegations over wednesday's incident. we are well aware that decisions on such actions and such terrorist attacks are not made in kyiv, but in washington. and kyiv is already executing what it is told to do,\" kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov said, without providing any evidence. belgium is preparing a new package of military aid for ukraine as russia's war continues, belgian prime minister alexander de croo said thursday. as we know, in these military aid packages, there are often practical obstacles. but i can tell you that there is not a single doubt in any of the belgian hearts and minds that we need to continue to support ukraine, de croo told a news conference in the hague alongside ukrainian president volodymr zelensky and dutch prime minister mark rutte.  de croo also said belgium was examining how seized russian assets could be fully used to support ukraine s war effort, as well as to aid the reconstruction of the war-torn country.  meanwhile, dutch prime minister mark rutte said thursday that while there were no taboos when it came to military support for ukraine, the question of whether nato would supply kyiv with f-16 fighter jets remained unresolved. we are not there yet, he added.  remember: ukraine has been lobbying for us-made fighter jets for several months, with officials arguing they are needed to defend against russian missile and drone attacks.  ukraine's message is that it will be a nato member after the war has ended, ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said on thursday. \"we are realistic and know that we will not be in nato during the war. but during the war we want to get a very clear message that we will be in nato after the war,\" zelensky said in a joint news conference in the netherlands with dutch prime minister mark rutte and belgian prime minister alexander de croo. zelensky said that while ukraine has received \"some positive messages\" from countries who support it, \"we need something more.\" \"i think that our friends will support us and see us in nato,\" the ukrainian president added. remember: part of russia s premise for its invasion of ukraine was to fend off nato from expanding close to its borders. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg has said, ukraine s future is in nato. even though ukraine is not a member of the alliance, and nato has insisted that it is not a party to the conflict, the bloc has played a critical role in supporting kyiv, donating billions in military aid and other support. at the news conference, zelensky also appealed for its allies to deliver their promised weapons to kyiv as quickly as possible. \"the most important thing now is to deliver what was promised to our soldiers as quickly as possible.\" the us and ukraine have vehemently denied moscow's unsubstantiated claims that both parties led an alleged drone strike targeting the kremlin and assassination attempt on president vladimir putin, the latest in a series of heated exchanges between ukraine and its western allies and russia over the incident on wednesday. here are the latest developments: diplomatic fallout: white house official john kirby called accusations from russia that the us directed ukraine to carry out an alleged drone attack on the kremlin and assassination attempt on president vladimir putin \"ridiculous.\"\n",

      " such attempts to disown this both in kyiv and in washington are, of course, absolutely ridiculous. the kremlin spokesperson doubled down on the accusations, without providing any evidence,

brought to kyiv so that kyiv fulfils [those tasks], peskov said. not every time kyiv is given the right to choose the means, this is also often ordered from across the ocean. washington must clearly understand that we know this, he added. peskov did not provide any evidence to his claims, nor additional details regarding the alleged attack, saying that information would be released later. he also told journalists putin is \"calm,\" despite the alleged attack and assassination attempt. you know that in such difficult, extreme situations, the president always remains calm, collected, clear in

are coming together to help ukrainians defend themselves, whatever their heart have this desire to help the feeling that more than the fate of one country is at stake,\" he said. some background: the icc has launched several war crimes investigations linked to russia's invasion of ukraine, where kyiv, allied officials and the media have reported alleged atrocities committed by moscow's troops. in march, the court issued arrest warrants for russian president vladimir putin and maria lvova-belova, a member of putin's government, for an alleged scheme to forcibly deport thousands of ukrainian children to russia. at the same time, the icc's chief prosecutor karim khan told cnn he believes russian president vladimir putin could stand trial for alleged crimes committed during the conflict, despite moscow s arguments that it is not subject to the court s decisions. cnn's rob picheta, lauren said-moorhouse and caitlin hu contributed reporting. russia's federal investigative authority is launching a probe into fires at oil facilities in the southwestern rostov region, after moscow accused ukraine of hitting the depots in a series of targeted attacks. according to a statement published by the russian investigative committee on telegram, the investigation will focus on the fires at the novoshakhtinsk oil products plant in rostov among other criminal actions by the armed formations of ukraine. kyiv has not commented on the fires. the russian investigative committee said an unmanned aerial vehicle crashed into the structures of the plant's inter-workshop flyover under construction,\" on wednesday night. the fire that resulted from the explosion was immediately extinguished. there were no casualties or injuries, and minor damage was caused to structures, the

the village of ilsky in the krasnodar region. it said it believed the blaze was caused by an attack of an unknown unmanned aerial vehicle. some context: border attacks between moscow and kyiv have been ramping up in recent weeks. they included civilian and infrastructure targets and suggest an attempt to exhaust each other ahead of an anticipated ukrainian spring offensive. russia launched its most forceful air bombardment on kyiv since the start of the year, the kyiv city military administration said, adding that ukrainian air defenses destroyed all of the missiles aiming at the capital. the barrage of attacks followed moscow's allegations that ukraine attempted to assassinate russian president vladimir putin in a drone strike at the kremlin overnight on wednesday, accusations kyiv has vehemently denied. here are the latest developments: kyiv resists russian strikes: all russian missiles and drones \"were destroyed in kyiv airspace\" by ukrainian air defense forces on thursday,

facility is close to the kerch bridge that was set ablaze by ukrainian forces in october 2022. it is unclear how the fuel storage tank caught fire. ukraine has not commented on the incidents. some context: cnn's chief international security correspondent nick paton walsh writes that ukraine is apparently striking at fuel depots in russian-occupied areas and inside russia itself seemingly precise attacks but ones to which kyiv is making no overt claim. increased cross-border attacks from both russia and ukraine in recent weeks appear to be an attempt to weaken each other ahead of a long anticipated spring offensive. ukraine s air force destroyed 18 of 24 drones fired by russia on wednesday night, it said in a statement released early thursday. on (wednesday night), the enemy again attacked with shaheds from the north (bryansk region) and from the south - the eastern coast of the azov sea,\" the statement said. \"this time, the air force, in cooperation with the air

the bloody trail that russia leaves with its shells, killing civilians in kherson and kherson region. zelensky added that at least 48 people were also wounded and sent his condolences to the families and friends of those affected.  we will never forgive the culprits, he vowed. we will defeat evil state and hold all the perpetrators to account.\" ##russian strikes## for days now, the blasts have echoed the condition each country s military is in. ukraine is apparently striking at fuel depots in russian-occupied areas and inside russia itself seemingly precise attacks but ones to which kyiv is making no overt claim. russia has been lashing out at what often seem to be civilian targets in ukraine, either in rage or through ineptitude. in uman, more than 20 people died; in pavlohrad, there were two dead and many injured. in kherson on wednesday, three were killed when a crowded hypermarket was hit at 11 in the morning. and in zaporizhzhia, two rockets slammed into a quiet residential garden that same overnight tuesday into wednesday, leaving a crater in a genteel, freshly sculpted lawn. nobody died in this last strike, but perhaps only because the first missile sent two families rushing for cover before the second struck. during the night, the city of zaporizhzhia was blasted with repeated air raid sirens a familiar noise in the past months, but this time accompanied by explosions, suggesting moscow s escalation, as russian forces apparently send s300 missiles into cities, according to local officials and accounts. we don t often know when russia hits a military target in ukraine, but the number of strikes on civilian targets suggests either extreme negligence and inaccuracy, or a tactic of intentionally terrifying ordinary people. a pattern is forming, outside of moscow s repeated disregard for human life. night by night, each side appears to be trying to weaken the other. the ukrainian strikes have hit obvious infrastructure targets railroad tracks, huge fuel depots which suggest both how researched their coming campaign is, and how poorly prepared russia is. it is still, for the most part, doing things in the same old, obvious way. the signals ahead of ukraine s long-heralded counteroffensive are getting louder. for two weeks, a slight uptick in clashes has been reported by pro-russian officials along the zaporizhzhia front lines, through which kyiv s forces will likely have to push if they are to separate the occupied peninsula of crimea from the rest of occupied ukraine a key strategic goal. it is unclear if this uptick is ukraine probing, or business as usual and that is entirely the point. read the full analysis here. us secretary of state antony blinken announced a new $300 million security assistance package for ukraine wednesday. this latest package will help ukraine continue to bravely defend itself in the face of russia s brutal, unprovoked, and unjustified war. russia could end its war today. until russia does, the united states and our allies and partners will stand united with ukraine, for as long as it takes, blinken said. the top us diplomat said it is the 37th drawdown of us arms and equipment for ukraine. here's what's in the package: additional ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems (himars)\n",

      "spare parts and other field equipment earlier wednesday, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre said the package comes after \"extensive work by the us government over the past few months to fulfill ukraine's requests ahead of its planned counteroffensive and ensure they have the weapons and equipment they need.\" the white house said it will continue to work with allies to support ukraine. previewing this aid package earlier this week, national security council coordinator for strategic communications john kirby suggested the new package would be \"very much focused on ammunition and clearing capabilities\" to give ukraine \"what they need to break through russian defenses.\" \"they will be ready,\" kirby said. russia claimed ukraine launched an attempt to kill russian president vladimir putin with a drone strike on the kremlin overnight on wednesday, an extraordinary allegation that was met with forceful denials in kyiv. the kremlin said the attack was foiled and the alleged drones destroyed. video that appeared on social media shows a bright flash and a puff of smoke over a part of the kremlin, the official residence of the russian president and the most potent symbol of power in moscow. in a statement, the kremlin said it regarded the alleged attack as terrorism and a deliberate attempt on putin s life. russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit, it added. ukraine denied involvement in the alleged strike. as president zelensky has stated numerous times before, ukraine uses all means at its disposal to free its own territory, not to attack others, the ukrainian presidential spokesman, sergiy nykyforov, told cnn on wednesday. us officials said they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible. whatever the truth, any admission of a security breach at the heart of the kremlin is remarkable. moscow said the alleged attack took place in the early hours of wednesday. the russian president was not in the building at the time, kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov said. cnn analysis of video showing the incident support the kremlin s claim that two drones were flown above the kremlin early wednesday, but did not show evidence of ukrainian involvement: read more here. ##kremlin incident##\n"

       "['the tight ring of security that surrounds the seat of the russian presidency was punctured in dramatic fashion by what appeared to be two attempted drone strikes in the early hours of wednesday morning. but until the kremlin chose to publicize the incident around 12 hours later, social media footage of the incident had gained little attention. why russia decided to reveal the security breach is unclear. but in a five-paragraph statement on wednesday, the kremlin made the incendiary claim that the drones were an assassination attempt launched by ukraine on the the russian president, vladimir putin. kyiv forcefully denied the claim. kyiv was bombarded with missiles in the hours following russia\\'s claims, in keeping with putin\\'s historic willingness to strike ukrainian cities after any alleged act of provocation. many details about the incident remain murky. here\\'s what we know -- and the questions that remain. what happened? moscow said the alleged attack took place in the early hours of wednesday. two \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" were intercepted and destroyed before they caused any damage or injury, the kremlin said. the russian president was not in the building at the time, according to kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov. videos then emerged on social media appearing to show the incident. cnn analysis of these videos supports moscow\\'s claim that two drones were flown above the kremlin. a video that appeared to show smoke rising from the kremlin surfaced on a telegram channel at 2:37 a.m. local time wednesday. the first reports of the incident citing the kremlin came via russian state media tass and ria around 2:33 p.m. local time -- around 12 hours later. shortly after the first media reports, another video appearing to show the moment a drone exploded above the kremlin began circulating widely on social media. in the video, the apparent drone seems to fly towards the building\\'s domed roof, followed by what looks like a small explosion. in this video, two people appear to be climbing on the dome holding flashlights, and can be seen ducking down just before the moment of the explosion. the people climbing the dome are not present in the first of these videos, but appear in the second, suggesting they were responding to the fire caused by the first drone at the time the subsequent drone appeared. who\\'s saying what? the kremlin blamed ukraine, describing the purported drone attack as an \"attempt on the president\\'s life.\" in a statement, the kremlin said, \"we view these actions as a planned terrorist attack and an assassination attempt,\" adding that \"russia reserves the right to take countermeasures wherever and whenever it deems appropriate.\" on thursday, russia also claimed the us was involved in the attack. \"undoubtedly, such decisions, the definition of goals, the definition of means -- all this is dictated to kyiv from washington,\" peksov said. both allegations drew sharp denials from kyiv and washington. \"we don\\'t attack putin or moscow,\" president volodymyr zelensky said during a news conference in helsinki on wednesday. \"we fight on our territory, we are defending our villages and cities. we don\\'t have enough weapon[s] for this. that\\'s why we don\\'t use it anywhere [else],\" zelensky said. \"we didn\\'t attack putin. we leave it to tribunal,\" he said. john kirby, the national security council\\'s coordinator for strategic communications, called russia\\'s allegation that the us directed ukraine to carry out such an attack \"ridiculous.\" secretary of state anthony blinken said it the us did not know who was responsible. \"i would take anything coming out of the kremlin with a very large shaker of salt,\" he told a washingon post event on wednesday. who else could be responsible? if ukraine wasn\\'t the perpetrator, one possibility is that the incident was the work of russian partisans -- as claimed by a former russian lawmaker linked with militant groups in russia. ilya ponomarev told cnn\\'s matthew chance that \"it\\'s one of (the) russian partisan groups,\" adding that \"i cannot say more, as they have not yet publicly claimed responsibility.\" ponomarev, who lives in exile in ukraine and poland, was the only russian mp to vote against the annexation of crimea by russia in 2014 and has since been included on a list of terrorist suspects, according to the russian authorities. according to ponomarev, members of partisans group inside russia are usually \"youngsters, students, residents of large cities. i am aware of the partisan activity in approximately 40 cities across russia,\" he told cnn. evidence of actual partisan activity inside russia remains scant. a formation calling itself the russian volunteer corps is fighting on the side of kyiv in ukraine and claimed to have carried out a brief armed incursion into russian territory earlier this year, but the group\\'s size is unclear. russia claims ukraine has carried out drone strikes on military airfields in western and southwestern russia, but kyiv has neither confirmed nor denied those allegations. us officials have also said they were still assessing the incident, and had no information about who might have been responsible. whatever the truth, any admission of a security breach at the heart of the kremlin is remarkable. what happens next? moscow already launched a wave of missiles at kyiv following the incident, a move in line with its playbook after previous flashpoints in the war. and messages written on russian drones launched at odesa overnight read \"for moscow\" and \"for the kremlin,\" according to the ukrainian military, an apparent reference to the alleged attack. us and ukrainian officials have in the past warned that russia has planned so-called \"false flag\" attacks along russia\\'s border with ukraine as a pretext for military escalation, including russian claims ahead of last year\\'s full-scale invasion that ukraine was sending \"saboteurs\" over the russian border. russia has also been embarrassed in recent months by symbolic incidents such as the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser moskva, the flagship of its black sea fleet, under disputed circumstances. moscow is also looking to project strength by following through with its planned victory day parade. peskov reiterated that the parade would go ahead as planned. but while russia has on occasion used missile bombardments around ukraine to show its anger following flashpoints in the conflict, the ground fighting in eastern ukraine has been bogged down in stalemate for months and it appears unlikely that wednesday\\'s incident will have a material impact on momentum.',\n",
       " 'our live coverage for the day has ended. follow the latest ukraine news\\xa0here\\xa0or read through the updates below. at least 23 people, including four children, were killed and at least 18 others were injured in a wave of russian missile attacks in central ukraine on friday. the death toll will likely continue to rise, officials said, and rescuers are still searching for missing children thought to be under the rubble of a struck apartment building in uman. there were 46 apartments inside one of the buildings that were hit, of which 27 were\\xa0completely destroyed, according to the minister of internal affairs ihor klymenko. the strike by a russian kh-101 cruise missile is thought to have caused the highest number of civilian casualties in a single incident since a missile struck an apartment block in dnipro in january. president volodymyr zelensky offered condolences to the victims\\' families and said the missile attacks underlined the country\\'s need for modern military aircraft. if you\\'re just now catching up, here are other headlines you should know: ukrainian shelling: the self-declared donetsk people s republic said nine people were killed in shelling by ukrainian forces in the city of donetsk. cnn cannot confirm the reported casualties, but unofficial telegram channels published\\xa0video\\xa0and\\xa0photos\\xa0of\\xa0extensive\\xa0damage\\xa0in several areas of the city.\\xa0 deported children: zelensky says he appealed to his chinese counterpart, president xi jinping, this week for help returning ukrainian children who were deported by russia. denied visit request: the us state department said it was \"deeply disappointed\" that its request to visit detained wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich in may was denied. the russian foreign ministry on thursday said it rejected the request in response to washington s denial of visas\\xa0to russian reporters accompanying foreign minister sergey lavrov s visit to the united nations this week. call for training on military jets: foreign minister dmytro kuleba reiterated the country\\'s call for f-16 fighter jet training from allies in a meeting with foreign ministers from eight countries on thursday. getting military training on how to maneuver the aircraft could be the first step in the country gaining access to the jets, kuleba said. visit by czech republic and slovak leaders: the presidents of the czech republic and slovakia visited ukraine on friday, their first joint visit abroad, slovakian president zuzana aputová said in a\\xa0tweet\\xa0on\\xa0friday. aputová said the visit is intended to bring \"a message of friendship, solidarity & support,\" noting that the three countries \"share parts of common history.\" grain import ban: zelensky called out the \"destructive\" impact of bans on ukrainian grain imposed by several european countries on the grounds that the imports were undercutting the other nations\\' domestic prices. he said friday he had discussed the issue with the president of the eu council, charles michel. putin\\'s decree: president vladimir putin signed a decree thursday that allows the deportation of ukrainian citizens from the territories declared annexed by russia if they are considered a \"national security threat.\" ##catch up## ##russian strikes## rescuers are still searching for missing children thought to be under the rubble of the apartment building hit by a russian missile friday in the central ukrainian city of uman. firefighters are trying to reach the lower floors of the bombed-out building, where they believe a young boy and girl are trapped, officials told a cnn team on the scene. the parents of both children survived the attack and have been trying to call the kids\\' cell phones. a call went through to one of the phones, but rescuers could not hear anything. police at the site have brought in psychologists and a dna testing center to help local families. a school near the blast site is providing shelter and clothing to families who lost their homes. the russian strike killed at least 23 people, including four children, and ukrainian authorities expect the death toll to climb. the uman strike came in a wave of attacks by russia\\'s forces across central ukraine early friday. president volodymyr zelensky discussed what he called the destructive impact of bans on the import of ukrainian grain by several european countries. the bans were enacted on the grounds that the imports were undercutting the other nations\\' domestic prices. he said friday he had discussed the issue with the president of the eu council, charles michel. \\xa0 i emphasize that this not only violates the existing association agreement between ukraine and the european union but also gives dangerous hope to the kremlin. the hope that in our common european home, someone\\'s wrong decisions can prevail over common interests. \\xa0zelensky added: it is necessary to find a normal, constructive way out of this situation in the european spirit. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky offered condolences to the families of more than 20 ukrainians killed in russian missile strikes on friday, almost all of them victims of a cruise missile that struck an apartment building in the city of uman. our air force managed to shoot down most of the russian missiles 21 out of 23. if not for this, the terrorist state would have managed to claim many more casualties, more lives, zelensky said. \\xa0he said ukraine could save people only with weapons. air defense, modern aircraft, without which there is no fully effective air defense. ##russian strikes## ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky says he appealed to his chinese counterpart, xi jinping, this week for help returning ukrainian children who were deported by russia. zelensky shared new details about the diplomatic call, which was held wednesday, during a joint press conference with the presidents of slovakia and the czech republic friday.\\xa0 zelensky said he used the \"important conversation\" to raise the plight of roughly 20,000 ukrainian children who kyiv accuses russia of forcibly deporting. the ukrainian president said foreign countries, including china, need to help ukraine bring the kids home.\\xa0 \"so far, only ukraine is helping ukraine with the return of children,\" zelensky said. key background: a report published in february by the yale humanitarian research lab outlined the expansive network of camps where russia has allegedly detained ukrainian children since the start of the war last year. in march, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for russian president vladimir putin and another kyiv official,\\xa0maria lvova-belova, accusing them of playing key roles in the scheme. beijing and moscow: zelensky\\'s call with xi comes at a time of increased western scrutiny on china\\'s relationship with russia. putin and xi\\xa0posed as peacebrokers\\xa0during a recent visit in moscow, but the chinese leader\\'s proposals on ending the war have not included a call for moscow to withdraw its troops from ukrainian land. zelensky said wednesday\\'s call included a discussion of ukraine\\'s territorial integrity. the ukrainian leader said he also received a \"positive response\" from china after outlining the risks faced by any country that supplies weapons to russia.\\xa0 us officials have warned in recent months that china could be considering crossing the \"red line\" and providing lethal military aid to russia. while the countries have strengthened ties, us officials say they\\xa0have not seen evidence\\xa0that china has provided extensive material support to the kremlin. cnn\\'s sam fossum contributed to this report. the us state department is \"deeply disappointed\" its request to visit detained wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich in may was denied, principal deputy spokesperson vedant patel said friday. \"we have been clear and consistent that american nationals detained abroad, especially those american citizens who are wrongfully detained like evan, like paul whelan, are allotted appropriate and regular consular access by our personnel. and so we\\'re going to continue to insist that,\" he said at a state department briefing. on thursday, the russian foreign ministry rejected the us request to see gershkovich, saying the decision was in response to washington s denial to provide visas to russian reporters for foreign minister sergey lavrov s visit to the united nations this week. some background: gershkovich was arrested in moscow in late march on spying charges, which the wall street journal has vehemently denied. gershkovich, who faces up to 20 years in prison, is currently being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious lefortovo prison until may 29. american citizen paul whelan has been held in russia for over four years. his sister attended the un security council meeting that lavrov chaired on monday, urging for his release his remarks prior to the meeting. the us state department has designated both gershkovich and whelan as wrongfully detained. the death toll from a russian missile strike on an apartment building in uman has increased to\\xa0at least 23, according to the ukrainian interior ministry. the death toll includes four children, officials said. the strike in uman, which is located in the central cherkasy region, injured at least 18 other people, ukrainian officials said earlier friday. there were 46 apartments inside one of the buildings that were hit, of which 27 were completely destroyed, according to minister of internal affairs of ukraine ihor klymenko. east of uman, a woman and her 2-year-old child were killed in a strike in dnipro, authorities said. ##russian strikes## the self-declared donetsk people s republic said nine people have been killed in shelling by ukrainian forces in the city of donetsk. the dpr s coordination center said that \"massive shelling\" killed six women, two men and an 8-year-old girl in the city center, injuring 16 others. cnn cannot confirm the reported casualties. but unofficial telegram channels have published video and photos of extensive damage in several areas of the city.\\xa0 the coordination center said that most of the strikes had been by ukrainian artillery using 155 mm shells targeting the central petrovsky district. but it also claimed that multiple launch rockets had been used. meanwhile on friday, ukraine said that russian strikes killed more than 20 people in the central city of uman. ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba reiterated the country\\'s call for f-16 fighter jet training from allies in a meeting with foreign ministers from eight countries thursday. kuleba, during a joint news conference at the summit in odesa, asked allies \"to make every effort to speed up the decision to start training ukrainian pilots on such aircraft.\" getting military training on how to maneuver the aircraft could be the first step in the country gaining access to the jets, kuleba said. \"we have to get russia out of the sky,\" the foreign minister told reporters. \"to do this, we need not only air defense systems, which our friends have already provided us with, but also combat aircraft. we need combat aircraft to cover our brigades that will carry out a counteroffensive. we need combat aircraft to protect the black sea and our coastal areas.\" foreign ministers from latvia, denmark, estonia, iceland, lithuania, norway, sweden and finland attended the joint meeting. oleksiy danilov, secretary of ukraine\\'s national security and defense council, emphasized the need for advanced military equipment and pointed to the death toll in friday\\'s strike in uman, which killed at least 22 people, including three children. \"every day that the decision to supply ukraine with modern combat aircraft is delayed means delaying the end of the war,\" he said in a tweet. some context: ukraine has long lobbied for the us and other western allies to send the country f-16s to help stunt russia\\'s invasion, but the fighter jets are sophisticated and can take months to learn how to fly. the us and other western allies have been skeptical of providing the jets to ukraine. russia has extensive anti-aircraft systems that could easily shoot the planes down, and some officials warn providing such equipment could be seen as provoking russia. cnn\\'s natasha bertrand and alex marquardt contributed to this report. rescue and recovery efforts are underway following overnight russian strikes on residential buildings in the central city of uman, ukraine.

ukraine on friday, their first joint visit abroad, slovakian president zuzana aputová said in a tweet\\xa0on\\xa0friday. aputová said the visit is intended to bring \"a message of friendship, solidarity & support,\" noting that the three countries \"share parts of common history.\" czech republic president petr pavel also confirmed the visit on twitter, saying that he and aputová \"both value freedom and justice.\" \"it\\'s difficult to witness first-hand the fact that ukrainians are paying the highest price for these the blood and lives of their fellow citizens,\" pavel said.\\n\"they are fighting the aggressor defending what we all stand for together. that\\'s why we will\\xa0support\\xa0them,\" he added. the czech president shared a picture of himself shaking hands with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and said he would push for accession talks with the european union to start for ukraine by the end of the year. he said eu and nato membership for ukraine \"is not a question of if, but when.\" the czech president also tweeted pictures of him visiting bucha, the kyiv suburb that was under russian occupation for over a month last year and has since become synonymous with russian atrocities. \"traveling to bucha, we came the same way as the russian military vehicles came about a year ago. memories of the barbaric slaughter of civilians remain here. ukrainians will never forget the hundreds of needlessly lost lives. we must not forget either,\" pavel said in a\\xa0separate\\xa0tweet. some background on pavel: he won the czech republic s presidential election in january and took office in march of this year, after a campaign featuring strong backing for nato and the european union and support for aid to ukraine. a former army chief, pavel became chairman of nato s military committee for three years before retiring in 2018.\\xa0 the visit comes after recent tensions between ukraine and several eastern european states. slovakia temporarily suspended grain imports from ukraine earlier this month, following similar moves by poland and hungary. farmers in countries neighboring ukraine have protested the effects of increased imports of ukrainian grain in their grain prices, the european commission said in a statement\\xa0in\\xa0march. a high-rise building with a well-known mural depicting a smiling family has been destroyed in the beleaguered ukrainian city of bakhmut in recent days, according to video geolocated by cnn.\\xa0 the footage on telegram shows an explosion at night and then smoke billowing out of the structure. while the building with a mural of a woman and baby wearing crowns made of leaves appears to have been decimated, the mural with a man and a boy holding a toy airplane remains. here\\'s what it looked like last year: president vladimir putin signed a decree thursday that allows the deportation of ukrainian citizens from the territories declared annexed by russia if they are considered a \"national security threat.\" according to the decree published online, residents from the annexed territories in donetsk, luhansk, zaporizhzhia and kherson who have not taken russian citizenship will be recognized as foreigners. they could be expelled from russia if they pose a threat to national security, the decree said, including where residents are allegedly advocating for \"a violent change in the constitutional order of the russian federation, planning or financing terrorist attacks or extremist crimes.\" some background: in september 2022, putin announced russia would seize of nearly a fifth of ukraine which is illegal under international law in the four regions, some of which are not even under full russian control. it followed so-called referendums in the regions that were universally dismissed as \"shams\" by ukraine and western nations. the decree also establishes that ukrainians living in such areas who do not carry a russian passport would have to apply for a residence permit. they will have to undergo fingerprint registration and provide a package of documents translated into russian. ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that people living in russian-occupied areas are being denied services when they don t hold russian documents. responding to the latest decree, mykhailo podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine, said, \"the occupier has seized a part of foreign territory, killed a certain number of civilians, and is forcibly throwing others out of their homes by the thousands. only because they do not want to become \\'citizens of the country-murderer\\'...\"\\xa0 \"the process of changing the ethnic composition of these territories where russians are being resettled is taking place. this is an obvious manifestation of the genocidal nature of the war,\" podolyak tweeted. remember: in march, the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for putin\\xa0and a russian official\\xa0for an alleged scheme to deport ukrainian children to russia. seventeen people have been confirmed dead in the city of uman following the russian missile strike early friday, officials have said. rescuers

by\\xa0iran\\xa0are powered by an engine based on german technology technology illicitly acquired by iran almost 20 years ago. the finding made through detailed examination of components recovered in ukraine and shared exclusively with cnn underlines iran s ability to mimic and finesse military technology it has obtained illegitimately. western officials are also concerned that russia may share western-made weapons and equipment recovered on the ukrainian battlefield with the iranians. so far, there s no firm evidence that has happened. however, relations between tehran and moscow have grown much closer. russia wants iranian drones and ballistic missiles; iran wants russian investment and trade. russia has become the largest foreign investor in iran over the past year, according to iranian officials. and for the russians, iranian drones are a bargain substitute for much more costly missiles, stocks of which are dwindling, according to western officials. experts believe that a shahed-186, for example, costs about $20,000, a tiny fraction of the cost of a kalibr cruise missile. read the full story here. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky sent condolences to victims of

explosions in or near the town of nova kakhovka, the site of an important hydro-electric project on the dnipro river.\\xa0videos showed smoke rising. the sound of a strike was heard in nova kakhovka, something is burning, one telegram channel said. smoke is visible. we also heard explosions that sounded like detonations. cnn is unable to confirm what targets might have been struck, but the russian-installed nova kakhovka district administration claimed the town was left without power supply due to shelling by ukrainian armed forces. there was also incoming fire on the ukrainian-held west bank of the dnipro river. shelling killed one woman and seriously injured her husband in a village nearby, the kherson regional military administration said. melitopol: a loud explosion was heard in melitopol, said its mayor, ivan fedorov. the russian-occupied city has been a hub for russian forces away from the front lines. an improvised explosive device detonated near the entrance of an apartment building, according to vladimir rogov, a senior official in the russian-appointed administration in occupied zaporizhzhia. the building was slightly damaged, he said, but there were no casualties. melitopol has been under frequent attack from missiles and long-range rockets, as well as improvised devices apparently planted by ukrainian partisan groups and aimed at officials in the russian-backed administration.\\xa0 elsewhere, in eastern ukraine: four children in the city of donetsk were injured when they tried to move an explosive device they found on the road, russian-appointed authorities in the region said. no further information was available on the incident. water supply in the russian-occupied part of ukraine\\'s donetsk region is dangerously low, according to denis pushilin, the head of the self-declared donetsk people\\'s republic. many households get just two hours of water supply every three days, the moscow-backed leader said in an online q&a session.\\xa0 the city of donetsk lost its main source of water, a canal that runs through the eastern ukrainian cities of chasiv yar and bakhmut. crews are still working to complete an alternative canal from the siverskyi donets river, which should bring relief from the water crisis, according to pushilin. \"the military is doing everything possible to speed up the resolution of this issue, he said of the canal work. \"but we need water today.\" to address immediate needs, pushilin said crews are building a water pipeline to the don river in russia. it will only improve the situation marginally but will increase water supply overall, he said. in the meantime, residents are using water pumped from the region\\'s mines. the mine water is of inadequate quality for the supply,\" pushilin said. \"this is disastrous for our water networks, which are already in a poor condition.\" some background: the canal supplying much of donetsk s water was built in the mid-20th\\xa0century. its route through chasiv yar takes it past heavy fighting between russian and ukrainian troops. its filtration station is near the town of avdiivka, another scene of constant battles. donetsk residents have told cnn the water situation is very difficult, especially on the upper floors of buildings because of inadequate pressure. maryna, a 42-year-old artist who lives on the outskirts of donetsk city, told cnn: we have been living with practically no water since last february. i can use water in the courtyard of a private house, (but) in my apartment, water comes for a few hours several days a week. we gather things, clothes to wash, now it is a luxury. my whole apartment is occupied by water containers because i have two children. the us is imposing new sanctions on groups in russia and iran accused of taking americans hostage as it works to prevent more captive-taking and potentially secure the release of citizens currently being detained. the move comes amid several high-profile cases of americans being wrongfully detained. evan gershkovich, a wall street journal reporter, and paul whelan, a former marine, are being held in russia on espionage charges they each vehemently deny. american citizens siamak namazi, emad sharghi and morad tahbaz are all being held in iran s notorious evin prison, where there have been reports of torture. the sanctions ordered up thursday would punish organizations the us accuses of being responsible for holding hostage or wrongfully detaining americans. in iran, four individuals are also coming under new sanctions. the groups are russia s federal security service and the intelligence organization of iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps. officials said the steps should act as a warning to those thinking of taking americans hostage. we are also showing that one cannot engage in this sort of awful behavior using human beings as pawns, as bargaining chips, without paying consequences and these are some of the consequences, a senior administration official said. but questions remain about the real impact of these sanctions because many of the entities hit on thursday were already sanctioned under different authorities by the us.',\n",

his earlier phone call with chinese president xi jinping on wednesday. according to zelensky, xi gave \"words of support for our black sea grain initiative and its extension, as well as support for our humanitarian efforts, in particular the grain from ukraine program. some context: the comments come days after russia threatened\\xa0to scrap the grain initiative, which enables the safe export of grain from ukrainian ports onto the world market. ukrainian naval forces in a facebook update on wednesday said, the black sea grain corridor is once again suspended by the russian side, without elaborating. as a result, four vessels were unable to leave the ukrainian ports including one vessel that is waiting for transit, the naval forces said. ukrainians are in what a senior us military commander called \"a good position\" for a counteroffensive against the russian military. on wednesday, gen. christopher cavoli, head of the us european command, told a congressional committee the us has worked with the ukrainians on a possible surprise attack. if you\\'re just now reading in, here\\'s what you should know: ukrainian journalist killed: a ukrainian journalist who was working as a fixer for the italian newspaper la repubblica was killed wednesday in a suspected russian strike\\xa0in kherson that\\xa0injured\\xa0his italian colleague, according to ukrainian officials. italian foreign minister antonio tajani earlier described the incident as a drone attack, but\\xa0the first\\xa0deputy head of the kherson regional council,\\xa0yurii sobolievskyi,\\xa0told cnn that authorities in kherson are still trying to establish the exact circumstances of the attack. russian submarines: russian submarine patrols have increased throughout the atlantic ocean despite the ongoing conflict in ukraine, according to gen. cavoli. expelled diplomats: ten diplomats working at norway\\'s embassy in moscow have been told to leave russia, a spokesperson for norway\\'s ministry of foreign affairs said wednesday. according to the spokesperson, oslo considers moscow\\'s move to be a reaction to\\xa0norway s expulsion of 15 russian embassy workers\\xa0earlier this month on accusations of spying. airline restriction: lot, poland\\'s state-owned airline, refused to board russian tennis player vitalia diatchenko in line with restrictions introduced following russia\\'s invasion of ukraine, the carrier said in a statement to cnn wednesday. diatchenko told cnn she is now back in moscow.\\xa0 ##catch up## russian forces have emptied out a key base in northern crimea, recent satellite imagery reviewed by cnn shows. the facility, near the village of medvedivka and close to the border of kherson, housed a significant number of russian armor.\\xa0 imagery from the european union s sentinel 2 satellite from january 21 shows a large footprint of russian equipment. higher resolution maxar images from february 11 reveals dozens of armored vehicles, including tanks and artillery pieces.\\xa0 newer imagery taken by the eu s sentinel 2 satellite reveals most of those vehicles are no longer present at the base.\\xa0 it wasn t immediately clear why moscow relocated the equipment or where to, but earlier in the month, russian-installed officials in crimea signaled that they expected a ukrainian counteroffensive to target the peninsula.\\xa0 i think the decision to build defensive structures in crimea and on the approaches to the peninsula was correct and justified, the russian-appointed crimean governor sergei aksyonov said on april 11.\\xa0 maxar imagery from february 11 to february 16 shows a large concentration of defensive structures near medvedivka, including a network of trenches and wedge-shaped anti-tank concrete barriers known as dragon s teeth. one maxar image from january 3 shows the fortifications were much smaller at the beginning of the year.\\xa0 in general, i can say that our armed forces have built a modern, deeply echeloned defense, aksyonov said. this does not mean that they will necessarily be used for their intended purpose. \\n we had to prepare for any scenario, and we did, he added. in light of aksyonov s comments, experts have suggested the withdrawal of russian military equipment from the base in medvedivka may be related to defensive operations ahead of a ukrainian counteroffensive. a ukrainian journalist who was working as a fixer for italian newspaper la repubblica was killed wednesday in a suspected russian strike\\xa0in kherson that\\xa0injured\\xa0his italian colleague, according to ukrainian officials. \"the moment i heard the news about this inauspicious event, i contacted our military forces, who provided me with details on the case.\\xa0i have been in touch with the journalist\\xa0(corrado zunino), and i will do everything that i can to help him,\" ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba\\xa0said\\xa0in an interview with italian broadcaster skytg24. kuleba said

the deceased journalist for the time being to allow time for ukrainian authorities to notify his next of kin.\\xa0 ten diplomats working at norway s embassy in moscow have been told to leave russia, a spokesperson for norway s ministry of foreign affairs said wednesday. norway s ambassador to moscow was today informed by the russian ministry of foreign affairs that 10 of our diplomats at the embassy in moscow have been declared personae non gratae in russia. the diplomats must leave russia within a short time, said the spokesperson, ragnhild simenstad. according to the spokesperson, oslo considers moscow\\'s move to be a reaction to norway s expulsion of 15 russian embassy workers earlier this month on accusations of spying. the norwegian ambassador was summoned by russia on wednesday, when \"a strong protest was expressed\" in connection with oslo\\'s decision to expel the 15 russian diplomats, the russian foreign ministry said in a statement.\\xa0 \"this hostile step further aggravated the situation in bilateral relations, which are already at a critically low level,\" the ministry said.\\xa0 the norwegian ministry\\'s simenstad said the russian decision is considered \"an act of revenge,\" adding that \"all our diplomats in russia carry out ordinary diplomatic work. the russian authorities know this well.\" while russia continues its fight in ukraine, the us military is\\xa0seeing that russian forces elsewhere have \"not been affected negatively\" by the war in ukraine.\\xa0 the top us general in europe said wednesday that russian submarine patrols have increased throughout the atlantic.\\xa0 \"one of those forces is their undersea forces. it\\'s hard to talk in public, as you well know, sir, about undersea warfare and our efforts in that regard. but i can say that the russians are more active than we\\'ve seen them in years, and their patrols into the atlantic, and throughout the atlantic, are at a high level, most of the time at a higher level than we\\'ve seen in years,\" gen. christopher cavoli, commander of us european command, told the house armed services committee on wednesday. and this is, as you pointed out, despite all of the efforts that they re undertaking inside ukraine, \\xa0he said. \\xa0 the ukrainians are \"in a good position\" for a counteroffensive against the russian military, the senior us military commander in europe told a congressional committee on wednesday.\\xa0 \"according to the modeling that we ve very carefully done with them, the ukrainians are in a good position,\" united states european command head gen. christopher cavoli said, adding that the us has worked with them on a possible surprise attack.\\xa0\\xa0 cavoli also said russia s ground force today is larger \"than it was at the beginning of the conflict,\" despite suffering numerous losses in its war against ukraine. \"the russian ground force has been has been degenerated somewhat by this conflict, although it is bigger today than it was at the beginning of the conflict,\" cavoli told the house armed services committee. aside from its ground forces, russia has a number of options left to them, he said. the air force \"has lost very little; they\\'ve lost 80 planes,\" he said. \"they have another 1,000 fighters and fighter bombers.\" \"so they still use all of that conventional power as well, and they mix them all together,\" cavoli said. poland s state-owned airline lot refused to board a russian tennis player in line with restrictions introduced following russia s invasion of ukraine, the carrier said in a statement to cnn on wednesday.\\xa0 vitalia diatchenko whom the airline did not name in their statement was denied boarding a lot flight departing from cairo on monday as she was traveling to calvi in corsica via warsaw and nice to play at a tournament.\\xa0 the airline confirmed to cnn that it \"could not accept a citizen of the russian federation on its flight,\" citing the restrictions introduced by poland s interior ministry during the covid-19 pandemic and updated in march 2022 following the ukraine invasion. \"the provisions of the regulation introduce restrictions at certain border crossings, including airport crossings, in relation to citizens of the russian federation traveling from outside the schengen area, the airline said. diatchenko told cnn on wednesday that she was unable to reach her destination after being denied flying due to her russian passport and is now back in moscow.\\xa0 according to reuters, the 32-year-old also said she attempted to purchase a ticket from german airline lufthansa but was advised that she could only enter the schengen area through spain, which had issued her visa. cnn was not able to independently verify this.\\xa0 some background: tennis has continued to welcome russian and belarusian athletes at international competitions, despite the international olympic committee executive board s initial recommendation in february 2022\\xa0that they be banned.\\xa0 in january, the ioc outlined a multi-step plan for russian and belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 summer games in paris and the 2026 winter games in milan. the ioc\\'s plan met criticism from the united states, canada and\\xa0several\\xa0european countries, including the united kingdom, germany and poland. according to the latest ioc recommendations released in march, athletes with a\\xa0russian\\xa0or belarusian passport must compete only as individual neutral athletes and meet all anti-doping requirements. those who support the war or are contracted to military or national security agencies cannot compete. ioc president thomas bach\\xa0defended the latest recommendations,\\xa0citing tennis

everything to prevent the terrorist state from using nuclear power facilities to blackmail ukraine and the world,\" zelensky tweeted. ukraine\\'s defense minister oleksii reznikov said \"the silence and lies of the soviet totalitarian regime about the tragedy led to terrible consequences that went far beyond the borders of modern ukraine.\" \"today, russia\\'s barbaric attacks near ukraine\\'s nuclear facilities, the occupation of the zaporizhzhia npp [nuclear power plant] and its transformation into a military base put the world at risk of a new disaster, the scale of which may exceed the accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant,\" he added. russian forces continue to control the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in europe. the plant has frequently been disconnected from ukraine s power grid due to intense russian shelling in the area, raising fears across europe of a nuclear accident. rafael grossi, director general of the international atomic energy agency [iaea], said wednesday he spoke with zelensky to mark the anniversary, adding the organization continues its efforts to protect the zaporizhzhia npp. zelensky reiterated his belief that return of the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) to his country\\'s control is the best way to prevent a nuclear disaster like the one that took place in chernobyl. \"on the anniversary of the chernobyl tragedy, i had a phone call with iaea director rafael grossi,\" zelensky said in a telegram post on wednesday. \"i stressed that only the return of ukraine s full control over znpp will protect the world from a new disaster.\" \"i also thanked for the iaea\\'s special program on medical support of ukrainian nuclear workers,\" zelensky added. what happened at chernobyl? when an explosion tore through chernobyl\\'s no. 4 reactor on april 26, 1986, more than 30 people were killed near pripyat, ukraine. countless others have died from radiation symptoms since, according to the iaea and the world health organization. the disaster sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over hundreds of thousands of square miles of ukraine, russia and belarus. the radioactive effects of the explosion were about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on hiroshima during world war ii. cnn\\'s olga voitovych contributed to this post. france \"encourages all dialogue that contributes to a resolution of the conflict [in ukraine] in accordance with the fundamental interests of ukraine and international law,\" the elysee palace said wednesday, following a call between the ukrainian and chinese presidents. the elysee said this was the same message french president emmanuel macron conveyed to his chinese counterpart during his visit to china this month. during this visit, macron told chinese president\\xa0xi jinping\\xa0he was counting on him to reason with russia and help end the war in ukraine. at the time, macron said russia had put an end to decades of peace in europe and that finding a lasting peace that respected internationally recognized borders was an important issue for china, as much as it is for france and for europe. macron also stressed a need for discussion with everyone including russia. we do not simply want an end to the conflict, but respect for ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is the only condition for lasting peace, he said. speaking to reporters alongside macron, xi said china was ready to issue a joint call with france for the international community to exercise restraint and avoid taking actions that might cause the crisis to further deteriorate. russian foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova said on wednesday that moscow has taken notice of china s willingness to facilitate negotiations with ukraine following the phone conversation between chinese president xi jinping and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky.\\xa0 we note the readiness of the chinese side to

comments\\xa0posted to one of his official twitter accounts\\xa0on wednesday. he said the terrorist case, alleged to have happened while he was in prison, was separate from an extremism case against him, for which there was a hearing at moscow s basmanny district court on wednesday. navalny said he had been told the case would be heard by a military court. key background: navalny is the best-known opposition politician in russia. he survived an attempt on his life after being poisoned with novichok nerve agent in 2020. last march,\\xa0navalny was sentenced to nine years in a maximum-security jail, according to russia s state media outlet tass, after being convicted on fraud charges\\xa0over allegations that he stole from his anti-corruption foundation. at the time, he was already\\xa0serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence\\xa0in a detention center east of the russian capital after being arrested in february 2021 for violating probation terms -- a verdict he said was politically motivated. he was relocated in june\\xa02022\\xa0to a maximum-security prison in melekhovo in the vladimir region, according to tass citing sergey yazhan, chairman of the regional public oversight commission. german and british fighter jets have intercepted three russian aircraft in international airspace over the baltic sea,\\xa0the german armed forces said on wednesday. two su-27 military aircraft and one il-20 were \"again flying without transponder signal,\" the\\xa0german armed forces tweeted. since nato countries estonia, latvia and lithuania don\\'t have their own fighter jets, the military alliance has secured the baltic airspace in northeastern europe since 2004. to this end, the allies regularly deploy fighter jets and personnel to the baltic sea states bordering russia. at the beginning of april, after eight months, the german armed forces, the bundeswehr, handed over command of the nato air surveillance mission to great britain. however, the german air force will continue to support it until the end of the month. alexey\\xa0navalny is being kept in solitary confinement for another 15 days, according to his spokesperson kira yarmysh.\\xa0 this is the 14th time [he s been returned to solitary confinement], she said on twitter. he will now spend a total of 158 days there. normally, after serving one term in the shizo [solitary cell], a convict is released for at least one night, but this was not the case for alexey. he has been given a new term without being released from the punishment cell at all. navalny said in quotes posted to his official twitter account: yesterday, after another 15 days [in the solitary cell] were over, i was immediately put back in the same shizo cell no. 11 normally, after 15 days in the shizo, the prisoner must spend at least one day in a regular cell before getting another 15 days in the shizo. so i\\'ve broken the system, albeit not in the way i\\'d hoped. the kremlin critic\\'s team says he is facing new criminal charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison. \"psychological torture\": earlier this year, the opposition leader\\'s daughter, dasha navalnaya, currently studying at stanford university in california, told cnn that prison authorities were repeatedly cycling him in and out of solitary confinement. they put him in for a week, then take him out for one day, to try to break him, she said. people are not allowed to communicate with him, and this kind of isolation is really purely psychological torture. a hearing in russian opposition leader alexey navalny\\'s case has started in moscow s basmanny district court in russia, according to a post on his team s official telegram account.\\xa0 the kremlin critic\\'s team says he is facing new criminal charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison. why is he in court? the hearing will consider a petition made to the court by the investigative committee of the russian federation, asking it to limit until may 5 navalny a.a. and his lawyers in the terms of familiarization with the materials of a criminal case, in which he is the defendant, according to the court s press service, as cited by russian state news agency tass.\\xa0 tass said the court did not specify which criminal case the petition referred to, but navalny\\'s spokesperson kira yarmysh tweeted on monday that the hearing concerned an extremism case against him. what navalny\\'s team says: the investigator demands to limit the time of familiarization with [the documents pertaining to] a gigantic criminal case, according to which alexey faces up to 30 years in prison. the ik-2 [the russian penal colony number in which navalny is held] doesn\\'t let one work with documents anymore: they bring them for a signature upon receipt and immediately take them away, the opposition figure\\'s team claimed.\\xa0 navalny s daughter daria navalnaya told cnn\\'s jim sciutto on tuesday that \"the case has 150 volumes\" and in each volume there are 250 double-spaced pages.\" navalny appeared at the hearing via video link, as seen in video broadcast by the afp news agency.\\xa0 the hearing was closed to the press, according to a tweet by his spokesperson yarmysh. russian president vladimir putin on tuesday signed a decree introducing possible retaliatory measures if russian assets abroad are seized, russian state news agency tass reported. the decree, which was also published on the kremlin website, outlines that if russian assets are seized by hostile countries, moscow will place foreign assets in russia under its temporary control, according to tass. the decree also declares that temporary management of assets can only be reversed and undone if the russian president decides so. tass reported that moscow has taken temporary management for assets of gas distributor uniper se s russian division. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov\\xa0was in the spotlight again tuesday when he\\xa0avoided directly answering a question about a possible prisoner swap for detained americans paul whelan and evan gershkovich. lavrov instead mentioned several russian nationals who are currently being held in us prisons. meanwhile, russia is focusing its forces on its assault of the eastern city of bakhmut, the ukraine military said. all of this while at least two people were killed and almost a dozen were injured during a\\xa0russian strike on kupyansk, a town about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the concentrated fighting in bakhmut. here are the top headlines you need to know: missiles moratorium in question:\\xa0russia may end its\\xa0self-imposed moratorium\\xa0on the use of its ground-based intermediate and shorter-range missiles, according to vladimir ermakov, the russian foreign ministry\\'s head of nuclear nonproliferation. russia would continue to adhere to the moratorium based on the us missiles deployed, their characteristics and their ability to reach the

to show a\\xa0drone strike\\xa0against a russian surveillance complex in kherson. the video is dated as monday, but cnn cannot confirm when the operation took place. there is growing evidence of ukrainian strikes against russian targets behind the front lines in the south.\\nevacuations happening:\\xa0ukrainian officials say\\xa0evacuation measures are being implemented\\xa0in some russian-controlled towns in the occupied zaporizhzhia region. ##catch up## ukrainian defense intelligence has released video appearing to show a drone strike against a russian surveillance complex on the east bank of the dnipro river in kherson. one of its units posted on telegram that the target was destroyed at the kakhovka hydroelectric plant at a distance of more than 6 kilometers (approximately 4 miles,) and eliminated a russian surveillance station. the video is dated april 24, but cnn cannot confirm when the operation took place. the video shows an operator watching surveillance video, purportedly from another drone. smoke emerges from the upper story of a building, which cnn has geolocated as on the russian-held side of the dnipro river at the power plant. the same unit posted video of road conditions, showing vehicles struggling to gain traction in seas of mud, with the commentary: as you can see, the weather conditions do not yet allow equipment and the military to work at full capacity. therefore, there will be a counteroffensive, but it takes time and conditions. be patient. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said that more than 60 museums and galleries in different regions of our country have also been destroyed or damaged by the occupiers since the invasion began. he said two women were killed in a russian attack using s-300 missiles on the kupyansk\\xa0museum in the kharkiv region. the town is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the front lines. he also said that a church was destroyed by a russian strike in the southern kherson region. this church became one of hundreds of churches and prayer houses destroyed by russian strikes, he said. zelensky alleged that russian forces had broken into the house of a tatar activist, abduresheet dzhepparov, in crimea. he is one of the representatives of the crimean tatar national movement, a human rights activist, a citizen of ukraine. it is unknown where he is now, what is happening to him. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov avoided directly answering a question about a possible prisoner swap for americans paul whelan and evan gershkovich, instead mentioning several russian nationals who are currently being held in us prisons. \"we have approximately 60 people who are serving sentences here. and in most cases, the accusations are dubious,\" lavrov said.\\xa0 \"they didn\\'t deign to comply with the requirements of the bilateral consular convention, under which if they have any suspicions about russian citizens, then they need to be not abducted like it\\'s done in hollywood films, but they need to turn to the russian federation and they need to lay out their concerns,\" lavrov said. some background on the two cases:\\xa0wall street journal reporter gershkovich was arrested in march and\\xa0faces up to 20 years\\xa0in prison on espionage charges, which the newspaper vehemently denies. whelan, a former marine who is a us, irish, british and canadian citizen, was detained at a moscow hotel in december 2018 by russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. he was\\xa0convicted and sentenced\\xa0in june 2020 to 16 years in prison. the us state department has designated both gershkovich and whelan as wrongfully detained, which lavrov again said that russia rejected. \"in the russian federation, there are several american citizens who are serving sentences for various crimes,\" lavrov said. \"i refer to paul whelan and evan gershkovich. they were detained when they were committing a crime: receiving material that was a state secret. and the vociferous, pathos-laced statements about journalists by definition not being able to commit crimes is something which we reject.\" lavrov added he believes those cases should be dealt with privately.\\xa0 \"the channel for the discussion of these matters exists. this is work that is not public in nature, and publicity here will only complicate the process for reasons which are understandable and there\\'s no need to tell you professionals about why,\" lavrov said.\\xa0 lavrov is\\xa0in new york\\xa0for the meeting of the un security council, as russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the council. russia may end its self-declared moratorium on the deployment of its ground-based intermediate and shorter-range missiles, according to vladimir ermakov, the russian foreign ministry\\'s head of nuclear nonproliferation. ermakov told state-owned media agency tass in an interview on tuesday that russia will only continue to adhere to its moratorium depending on the range of us missiles deployed, their characteristics and their ability to reach the asia-pacific region. in particular, the readiness of russia to continue adhering to the unilateral moratorium on the deployment of ground-based medium-range and shorter-range missiles in certain regions will fundamentally depend on the specific parameters of [us] missiles range, ermakov said. \"but even now we can say with confidence that the destabilizing military programs of the united states and its allies are making our moratorium more and more fragile, both in the asia-pacific region and in europe,\" he said.\\xa0 some background:\\xa0the united states\\xa0withdrew from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty\\xa0with russia in 2019. the agreement, signed in 1987 by us president ronald reagan and soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev, limited both nations from fielding both \"short range\"\\xa0and \"intermediate range\"\\xa0land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and missile launchers that could be used to carry either nuclear or conventional payloads. then-us defense secretary mark esper said the 2019 withdrawal was \"a direct result of russia\\'s sustained and repeated violations of the treaty over many years and multiple presidential administrations.\" as a result of the us decision, russia also announced its withdrawal from the accord. but russia claimed it would continue a moratorium on the deployment of such weapons. at the time, russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said: \"we invited the us and other nato countries to assess the possibility of declaring the same moratorium on deploying intermediate-range and shorter-range equipment as we have, the same moratorium vladimir putin declared, saying that russia will refrain from deploying these systems when we acquire them unless the american equipment is deployed in certain regions.\"\\xa0 nato secretary general jens stoltenberg dismissed russia s offer of a moratorium as \"not credible,\" because he said russia had been deploying such missiles for years.\\xa0 remember:\\xa0in february, russian president\\xa0vladimir putin\\xa0said he was suspending his country s participation in the\\xa0new start\\xa0nuclear arms\\xa0reduction treaty, which put limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons that both the us and russia could have.']"
